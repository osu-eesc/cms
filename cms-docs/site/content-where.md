# You have content, great! Now where should it go?

## Extension Website

Best place for:
  * Relevant, timely content for external audiences (gardeners, youth, teachers, parents, etc.), including content related to topic areas and Extension program and county info
  * Content tied to OSU Extension core mission and organizational goals
  * Content that we (OSU Extension) have created and published
  * Engaging, high-quality content
  * Things we want to track with the Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software. Integrating of this software will be part of phase 2, after initial public launch.
  * Content that meets the website’s [guiding criteria](http://blogs.oregonstate.edu/extensionweb/strategy/#criteria)

The content is going on the Extension website, great! [Here are the options](#content-options-for-the-extension-website).

Not a good place for:
  * Extension faculty and staff resources
    * Solutions: Use “Employee Intranet/Employee Resources” or Extension ConnEXTion
  * Historical documents, reference materials (i.e., using website as a clearinghouse or library of content)
    * Solutions: Use Box or archive as appropriate
  * Content that needs work
    * Solutions: Before adding content to the new site, review and/or revise to ensure accuracy. Revise or redesign to ensure it is on brand.
  * Volunteer resources
    * For now, a combination of the Extension website and Box is a likely solution. When your team is ready to add volunteer content, please let us know. Together, we can decide on the most logical short-term solution.
    * As we address this for various content teams, we may be able to provide more general recommendations that work for most.

The content doesn’t make sense on the Extension website? Ok, details about other options are below.

## Employee Intranet/Employee Resources

The OSU Extension [Employee Intranet site](https://employee.extension.oregonstate.edu/) is the best place for statewide resources for internal use. In the future, we can make ongoing improvements to our internal site, with the goal of making it a more robust, interactive platform for information, communication, and collaboration.

Best place for:
  * Content for OSU Extension employees that is useful long-term and doesn’t need to be password protected

Not a good place for:
  * Content for a smaller audience, i.e. work groups, projects, committees
    * Solutions: Use Box or OSU WordPress
  * Employee related news items
    * Solutions: Submit to Extension ConnEXTions
  * Files that need to be password protected
    * Solutions: Use Box

## Extension ConnEXTions

Best place for:
  * Timely organizational news and information for OSU Extension employees
  * Announcing new employee resources available on the Employee Resources site

Not a good place for:
  * Urgent communications
    * Solutions: Please email the OES state list
  * Resources that will be useful for a long duration of time
    * Solutions: Submit content to Employee Resources site

## Box

Best place for:
  * Documents for smaller groups (teams, projects, committees) for both Extension employees and volunteers
  * Meeting notes, agendas, etc.
  * Password protected documents. However, please see [OSU data management and classification](http://is.oregonstate.edu/ois/data-management-and-classification-overview) for details about storing sensitive or confidential data.

About:
  * Documents in Box can be shared with people inside and outside OSU (they don’t need to have an ONID account to view a Box folder). To share, create a folder on Box then click “Share” to invite people to see it. You can also make it available to anyone with the link. Any documents within this folder will have the same permissions.
  * Box can include Google Docs. [Learn more about Box](http://box.oregonstate.edu/).

## Webforms (Qualtrics/Google Forms)

Webforms are not currently available on the Extension website. During Phase 2 we’ll revisit. In the meantime, we recommend using [Qualtrics](http://main.oregonstate.edu/qualtrics) or [Google Forms](http://is.oregonstate.edu/google).

Best place for:
  * Webforms to collect non-sensitive user data from the general public
  * Surveys

Not a good place for:
  * Collecting sensitive data. Please see [OSU data management and classification](http://is.oregonstate.edu/ois/data-management-and-classification-overview) for details about storing sensitive or confidential data.

Note:
  * For large event management or online class enrollment, please see the [registration system info](https://employee.extension.oregonstate.edu/employee-resources/registration-system) through PACE.
  * For collecting OSU Extension faculty and staff data, the [Employee Intranet / Employee Resources](https://employee.extension.oregonstate.edu/) site may be an option. Please contact the project team to see if this is a good fit.

## OSU Wordpress sites

**If you have an existing Wordpress site** for Extension content and want to start planning how to incorporate relevant content from it into the OSU Extension website, please contact the appropriate [content team](http://blogs.oregonstate.edu/extensionweb/content-teams/). Content team leaders, please [contact EESC](http://blogs.oregonstate.edu/extensionweb/contact/) when you are ready to begin this conversation.

**If you are thinking of creating a new Wordpress site** for Extension content, [let's talk first](http://blogs.oregonstate.edu/extensionweb/contact/) and confirm that that's the best solution for your needs.

Best place for:
  * Content that isn’t for a broad number of external users (i.e., work groups, projects, committees, associations)

Examples:
  * Extension association websites ([OSUEA](http://blogs.oregonstate.edu/osuea/), [OAEA](http://blogs.oregonstate.edu/oaea/), [ESP](http://blogs.oregonstate.edu/espgamma/))
  * [OSU Extension Web Upgrade Project](http://blogs.oregonstate.edu/extensionweb/)

Not a good place for:
  * Content for external audiences (gardeners, youth, teachers, parents, etc.), including content related to topic areas or programs
    * Solution: Use Extension website
  * Anything we want to track with the Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software
    * Solution: Use Extension website

ScholarsArchive@OSU
Best place for:
  * Historical documents
  * [Research articles](https://guides.library.oregonstate.edu/Scholars-Archive/FacultyArticles)

Note: EESC is responsible for archiving OSU Extension Catalog publications.

## OSU Library website archive

For websites that are historical (i.e., no longer maintained), we recommend getting the website scanned by OSU Library. The website will continue to be available on the library servers -- and a “this site is an archived website and is no longer being updated” note will be added to the top of every page.

Please contact the EESC Web and Content Strategy team if this is something you are interested in.
