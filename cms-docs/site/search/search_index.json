Project A Project represents an activity done by Extension that is of interest to the public. A project might be \u201cof interest\u201d because of outputs, impact on the community, etc. Projects differ from \u201cprograms\u201d (see next section) because they do not offer an ongoing opportunity for public participation. Some examples of Projects are Family and Community Health\u2019s BEPA-Toolkit or Small Farms\u2019 Organic Fertilizer and Cover Crop Calculators . Both of these consist of resources that have been developed that are presented with documentation/instructions, background research, progress updates, etc. Projects are are maintained through Content Team groups. Content will include options to add: * Photos, Videos, and Text * Featured Content * Project Materials List * Tabbed Section: allows you to display other sections in tabs, where only one tab is displayed at a time and users can switch between them If you have content that you think would be appropriate as a project, please contact the EESC web team and we will set it up for you.

Example: * OSU Extension in Benton County (Facebook) To add social media link to county or program landing pages, tag the social media link with the appropriate tags. Sub-page This is primarily for informational, non-educational content. Example: * An \u201cabout page\u201d for a program or county Sub-pages connect to county or program landing pages. Video An educational or informational video. Examples: * How to prune apple trees * Introduction to NWREC To add video to topic, county and/or program landing pages, tag the video with the appropriate tags. Note: Videos first need to be uploaded to MediaSpace or YouTube. Before creating a new educational video, please consider a short planning discussion with EESC--as there may be opportunities to work together to broaden the audience or reach.

Do's and Don'ts for content entry Here are some tips when adding content: General tips and considerations * Don't upload OSU catalog publications , they are already on the site (or will be before launch). * Don't upload publications from other universities . These publications should be added as an Online resource (i.e. a link to the publication on their website). * Don\u2019t UPPERCASE text . Reading speed for all caps text is reduced by 10% and users are put off by the appearance of shouting. * Do review and assess content to determine if it is still relevant and accurate, especially if it hasn\u2019t been updated in several years. * Do avoid uploading PDFs when possible. Why? HTML pages (like an Article ), are more user friendly, accessible, mobile friendly, and more likely to be returned in a Google search. For simple 1-2 page PDFs, consider converting them into an Article . Educational document * Do add OSU produced documents as an Educational document * Don\u2019t add documents produced outside OSU as an Educational document . Online resource * Do add links to content not produced by OSU. These should be entered as an Online resource . Adding topics, keywords, county and program tags to a piece of content (e.g. an article) Here is a quick overview about what each tag does: * Topic : This causes the content to automatically show up on topic pages. When users search, they will be able to filter results by topic. * Keywords : This doesn\u2019t place the content on any page, however: * When a user searches, they will be able to filter results by keyword. * When a user visits a topic page, they will be able to filter what they see on that page by keyword. * Programs can set up a page to show content tagged with that program and a given keyword. * Program : If a program has set up a page to show content that\u2019s been tagged with it, selecting that program here will cause that to show up on that page. * Region : This is set to \u201cStatewide\u201d by default. If the information is only applicable to a certain part of the state, select it here. When a user searches or visits a topic page, they will be able to filter what they see by region. * Counties : Use this when a piece of content is county-specific, for example: events, news, and programs. In phase 2, this will be used to generate \u201cevents near me\u201d pages for users and similar functionality. Tips * It is not necessary to have the same term as both a keyword and a topic. * Content will only show up on topic pages if it has a topic associated with it, but it will show up in search no matter what. Here\u2019s an example. If you wanted a certain piece of content (e.g. article) to show up on the \u201cinvasive species\u201d topic page, the \u201cberries\u201d topic page, the Master Woodland Manager page, and be tagged as resource that is relevant statewide, it should be tagged like this: * Topic: \u201cInvasive Species\u201d, \u201cBerries and Grapes\u201d * Keywords: \u201cgrapes\u201d, [and whatever more specific keywords are appropriate] * Program: Master Woodland Manager * Region: statewide Keywords It is useful to think of keywords in the extension CMS as \u201cthird-level topics\u201d, or as a way to further divide content on topic pages. If the Extension website was a bookstore, topics would be large signs at the end of aisles, and keywords would be smaller labels on the shelves. For example, there might be a \u201cVegetables\u201d aisle with a \u201cCarrots\u201d shelf. Functionally, keywords serve three purposes: 1. Allow end-users to get more specific information on topic pages and search results 2. Allow program groups to organize content tagged with their program by subject 3. Make content show up higher in searches for a word or phrase it is tagged with (this is similar for all types of tags) Keyword guidelines to follow: 1. Reuse existing keywords if possible . As you type in the keyword box, keywords that already exist and match what you typed will appear in a list where you can select them. You will know you are reusing an existing keyword if a number appears next to it in the box (this is the numeric ID of that keyword). 2. Keywords need to be separated by a comma . 3. Use all-lowercase letters unless the keyword contains a proper noun. 4. Try to use nouns whenever possible (instead of adjectives or verbs). E.g. \u201csustainability\u201d instead of \u201csustainable\u201d. 5. Only use one \u201cform\u201d of each keyword . E.g. don\u2019t tag a piece of content with both \u201capple\u201d and \u201capples\u201d. 6. Don\u2019t repeat information in other fields . E.g. if you have tagged content with the region \u201cCentral Oregon\u201d, you don\u2019t need to add it as a keyword. 7. Avoid acronyms . 8. Use keywords that could apply to more than one piece of content . 9. Each keyword should contain a single idea . E.g. instead of \u201ctrees and shrubs\u201d use the separate keywords \u201ctrees\u201d and \u201cshrubs\u201d. Level 1 and 2 topics We expect the list of topics and subtopics to evolve over time. EESC will periodically adjust topics as needed based on content, content team feedback, user feedback, and analytics. We welcome feedback from content teams about topics at any time. Topics should: * Include the highest priority content for your program area * Be areas that will continue to get fresh content over time * Easy for users to understand and be terms users would use to do a search Topics should not: * Include internal jargon * Require users to know Extension organizational structure or program area names to find content Criteria for requesting a new topic: * There is quite a bit of content * There is a content team associated with the topic * There is user feedback or other data that supports the need for and label for the topic To provide feedback, suggest a change to existing topics, or request a new topic, contact EESC Web and Content Strategy team . Remember: Topics are shared and anyone adding content can tag with the topic if appropriate. No single group \u201cowns\u201d a topic. However, some topics naturally have more content from certain groups than others. Best practices for small screens The new Extension website is mobile friendly; this means we need to plan to have our content look good on small screens as well as large screens. Why do small screens matter? Over 50% of website traffic is on small screens (i.e. cell phones). This means we need to be thoughtful of how we add content to our websites so it can be easily read on these screen sizes. Learn what works and what doesn\u2019t Viewing content on a smaller screen can have surprising results. Try adding content to the website and looking at it on a cell phone -- or on a computer and \u201csquishing\u201d the page so you can see what it will look like on smaller screen sizes. When you do this regularly when you work on content, you\u2019ll more easily be able to anticipate what ways of displaying content will work well. Displaying text with an image Saving text within an image should be avoided. This is an accessibility issue, as the text can\u2019t be read by screen readers for those with impaired vision; And the text may be too small to read within the image on smaller devices. We are legally responsible to provide content that can be read by all audiences. We recommend using image captions when text needs to be displayed with an image. Remove unnecessary words, phrases, or sentences For mobile content, concise writing is essential. It should be just long enough to convey the information, without anything unnecessary.
