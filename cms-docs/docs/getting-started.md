# Getting Started with Content: A Quick-Start Guide

## You have content, great! Now where should it go?

### Extension Website

Best place for:
  * Relevant, timely content for external audiences (gardeners, youth, teachers, parents, etc.), including content related to topic areas and Extension program and county info
  * Content tied to OSU Extension core mission and organizational goals
  * Content that we (OSU Extension) have created and published
  * Engaging, high-quality content
  * Things we want to track with the Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software. Integrating of this software will be part of phase 2, after initial public launch.
  * Content that meets the websiteâ€™s [guiding criteria](http://blogs.oregonstate.edu/extensionweb/strategy/#criteria)

The content is going on the Extension website, great! [Here are the options](#content-options-for-the-extension-website).

Not a good place for:
  * Content for a smaller audience, i.e. work groups, projects, committees
    * Solutions: Use Box or OSU WordPress
  * Employee related news items
    * Solutions: Submit to Extension ConnEXTions
  * Files that need to be password protected
    * Solutions: Use Box
