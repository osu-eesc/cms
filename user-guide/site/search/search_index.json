Content Entry Workflow In general, you will need to follow these steps when entering content on the Extension website: See if the content already exists on the site. See Planning and evaluating content . Determine whether the content is appropriate for the Extension website. See Getting Started with Content . Check that the content meets quality and legal standards. See Content Requirements and Best Practices . Determine which Group and content type you should use. See Getting started with Content and the Content Type descriptions below. If you are planning to upload a file, check out File Management . Log in to the site and go to your My Groups page. Select the group you identified in step 4 and click the \u201cadd\u201d button for the desired content type. See Using the site . Fill out the fields for the content and save. See the appropriate content type section below. Publish the content when it is ready. See Managing Content: Content Publishing . Make sure that the content is displaying everywhere it needs to. Update the tags if necessary. See Displaying and organizing content on other pages . Periodically check the content to ensure it is still relevant. Archive it if it goes out of date. See Managing Content: Content Publishing later in this guide. Announcement What It Is A short, time-sensitive piece of information that you need to call attention to. Also used to advertise seasonal services such as clinics and hotlines. Examples: An office closure An application or registration deadline Master Gardener plant clinic information A notice about food safety recalls or pest alerts Announcements are not for individual events such as a workshop or lecture. Also, announcements only display on the site for a set period of time, so they shouldn\u2019t be content that needs to remain visible long-term. Who Can Add It Members of program or county office groups. If an announcement applies to more than one county or program, coordinate to make sure to add it only once. Quick Tip : If an announcement has been entered that needs to be edited, added to or removed from your page, you should contact the uploader of the announcement. See \u201cWorking with Other Content Authors\u201d . Instructions On the edit screen for an announcement, you will see the following fields: Display dates : dates during which the announcement should be visible. The announcement will display during the start and end date specified. For example, if you want an announcement to display on January 1, 2, and 3, you would select the dates January 1\u2013January 3. Short Description : a short summary of the announcement. This will show in \u201cteasers\u201d followed by a \u201cRead more\u2026\u201d link to the full announcement content. Content : the full content of the announcement. Additional Counties and Additional Programs : other counties and programs where the announcement should show. You do not need to include the county and program you are using to add the announcement. Announcement Topic : specifies on which topic page(s) the announcement should show. How and Where It Displays Topic, program, and county landing pages display one announcement teaser . After the teaser is a button to \u201cSee All Announcements.\u201d This page shows teasers for all announcements for that topic, program, or county. Each teaser links to the full announcement content. Example announcement teaser on a landing page Announcements in a county or program group automatically show up for that county or program. They will also show up for counties and programs specified in the \u201cadditional counties\u201d and \u201cadditional programs\u201d fields. You can add an announcement to a topic page using the \u201cannouncement topic\u201d field. Teasers will only display during the dates specified in the \u201cdisplay dates\u201d field. Article What It Is A text-based piece of educational content. This is the preferred way to enter educational content owned by OSU Extension. Articles stay on the site long-term, so they shouldn\u2019t contain content that is only relevant for a short time. Use newsletter issues or announcements for these instead. Who Can Add It Members of Content Team groups. Instructions On the edit screen for an article, you will see the following fields: Title : the title of the article Summary/deck : a short description of the contents of the article that display in the teaser Content : the full article content Images : images that go with the article. These will display in a column on the right-hand side of the article\u2019s text. Thumbnail : image that displays in the article\u2019s teaser. If this is empty, it will use the first image in the \u201cimages\u201d field. If this is empty, it will use a default image based on the topic. Topics, Keywords, Programs, and Regions : see below Author and Publishing Information : information about the content for future maintenance. If the content\u2019s author is an OSU Extension employee, start typing their name into the first \u201cAuthor(s)\u201d field and select them when they come up. This will associate the content with their profile on the site. If the content\u2019s author is not an OSU Extension employee (including OSU employees who don\u2019t have an Extension appointment), enter their information in the \u201cNon-Extension Author(s)\u201d fields. Quick Tip : Web visitors often scan content on the web to see if it is useful for what they need. Make your article more readable by using these accessibility and writing for the web tips. How and Where It The tags in the \u201cTopics, Keywords, Programs, and Regions\u201d section of the edit screen determine where the article displays. Topic : It will show in the \u201cBrowse All Resources\u201d page for the specified topic(s). Other content tagged with the topic will show at the bottom of the article in a \u201cRelated Resources\u201d section. Program : If the specified program has added a \u201cProgram Tagged Content List\u201d section to one of its pages, it will show up there. See the Subpage section for more information. Counties and Programs can display articles on a page by adding a \u201cfeatured content\u201d section. Collection What It Is A grouping of existing pieces of educational content. Examples: A series of articles or documents that make up a course Content for a specific audience Collections must be maintained by the content team. This can be time consuming. As new content is added to the website, it must also be manually added to the collection. This doesn\u2019t happen automatically as it would for content tagged with a Topic (see Displaying and Organizing Content on Other Pages for more information). Collections may have gaps if new content is not added or if all related content wasn\u2019t added when first creating the collection. Collections serve a specific purpose and are not a solution for all needs, especially where the website is helping to organize the content too. You don\u2019t usually need a collection for grouping content based on geographical region or topic. Filters on topic pages can accomplish this. Who Can Add It Members of Content Team groups. Instructions Before you create a collection, be sure to find (or add to the site, if needed) all the content that should be part of it. On the edit screen for a collection, you will see the following fields: Title : the title of the collection Short Description : a summary of the collection\u2019s contents that will show in the teaser Introduction : text that will appear before the collection items Items : the pieces of content in the collection To add a piece of content, click \u201cAdd Collection Item.\u201d Then click the \u201cSelect\u201d button to open the content browser and select the piece of content. Troubleshooting Tip : The content browser allows you to select multiple pieces of content for a single collection item. However, we recommend selecting only one at a time. This makes it easier to organize content: collection items can be reordered, but pieces of content in a single collection item will always be in the order they were selected. To organize content into sections with titles, click \u201cAdd Collection Section.\u201d This will provide you with fields where you can specify the title of the section and the pieces of content that appear in that section. For More Information : text that will appear after the collection items Thumbnail : image that will display in the teaser. If this is empty, it will use a default image based on the topic. Topics, Keywords, Programs, and Regions : see below Author and Publishing Information : information about the content for future maintenance If the content\u2019s author is an OSU Extension employee, start typing their name into the first \u201cAuthor(s)\u201d field and select them when they come up. This will associate the content with their profile on the site. If the content\u2019s author is not an OSU Extension employee (including OSU employees who don\u2019t have an Extension appointment), enter their information in the \u201cNon-Extension Author(s)\u201d fields. How and Where It Displays Collections display just like articles, educational documents, and other pieces of educational content. They display on topic and program pages based on the tags in the \u201cTopics, Keywords, Programs, and Regions\u201d section of the edit screen. Topic : It will show in the \u201cBrowse All Resources\u201d page for the specified topic(s). Other content tagged with the topic will show at the bottom of the collection in a \u201cRelated Resources\u201d section. Program : If the specified program has added a \u201cProgram Tagged Content List\u201d section to one of its pages, it will show up there. See the Subpage section for more information. Counties and Programs can add collections to a page by adding a \u201cfeatured content\u201d section. County Office What It Is Represents information about a county and content on its main page. Who Can Add It These have been set up for you. No one can add or delete them. Instructions The edit screen for a county office has three sections: Landing Page : this is the main page visitors see for the county. The content on this page acts like a subpage. See the Subpage section of this guide for more information. Sidebar : You can add additional links to the sidebar on county pages. These will show up on every page associated with the county. County Info : This is where you will be able to edit the location and contact information for a county. Quick Tip : Members of county groups can feature educational content entered by Content Teams on their pages. See: Organizing and Displaying Content on Other Pages . How and Where It Displays There is a list of all counties on the Find Us page. The link to \u201cFind Us\u201d is in the top black menu bar at the top of every page. The sidebar on participant-based program pages also have links to the counties where that program is active. Educational Document What It Is A document (PDF, Word Document, Excel spreadsheet, or PowerPoint presentation) containing educational information. In almost all cases, educational documents would work better as articles. This makes the content more accessible, searchable, and maintainable. Articles can also be saved and printed. Content should only be an educational document if: it is slides from a presentation, it has a lot of complex, in-context graphics or formatting, or it is a fillable or otherwise interactive document. Educational documents are not appropriate for program forms, event information, driving directions, and other content that is not educational. Instead, these should usually be program resources, events, newsletters, or announcements. Quick Tip : There are several options available for you to upload files. The best place depends on the audience the document is intended for, whether it will have new versions in the future, and whether it should be private to a certain group. See File Management for more information. Catalog publications should not be added as educational documents. These are added and maintained by EESC. Important Note: Be sure you have permission to share the file before you upload it to the Extension website. See Copyrighted Content. Who Can Add It Members of Content Team groups. Instructions On the edit screen for an educational document, you will see the following fields: Title : the title of the document Document Type : this will display as a label in the document\u2019s teaser. It helps to provide context to visitors. If empty, \u201cEducational Document\u201d will display. Document Upload : upload the document. When you upload from your computer, you will need to name the document again. You can use the title, the file name, or whatever will help you find it again if you need it in the future. Short Description : a summary of the document\u2019s contents that will show in the teaser Thumbnail : the image that will show in the teaser. If this is empty and the document is a PDF, it will use an image of the first page of the document. If the document is not a PDF, it will use a default image based on the document\u2019s topic. Topics, Keywords, Programs, and Regions : see below Author and Publishing Information : information about the content for future maintenance. If the content\u2019s author is an OSU Extension employee, start typing their name into the first \u201cAuthor(s)\u201d field and select them when they come up. This will associate the content with their profile on the site. If the content\u2019s author is not an OSU Extension employee (including OSU employees who don\u2019t have an Extension appointment), enter their information in the \u201cNon-Extension Author(s)\u201d fields. How and Where It Displays The tags in the \u201cTopics, Keywords, Programs, and Regions\u201d section of the edit screen determine where the educational document displays. Topic : it will show in the \u201cBrowse All Resources\u201d page for the specified topic(s) Program : If the specified program has added a \u201cProgram Tagged Content List\u201d section to one of its pages, it will show up there. See the Subpage section for more information. Counties and Programs can add educational documents to a page by adding a \u201cfeatured content\u201d section. Event Video: What It Is An event that a visitor to the website could attend. If it isn\u2019t a gathering someone can attend, it shouldn\u2019t be an event. This includes deadlines, office closures, and \u201cservices\u201d such as a plant clinic or hotline. Instead, these should be announcements. Why Do This Showcase and track the amount of on-the-ground programming that you do Expand your outreach to local and new audiences about your events Have a place to direct people for learning more and registering for the event Can enter once and have it fed to the OSU calendar (and Forestry Extension page if relevant) Be able to send specific events to interested people through future digital strategy Find out which events are most viewed and by what audiences through analytics Who Can Add It Any user on the site. If an event applies to more than one county or program, coordinate and make sure to add it only once. Quick Tip : If an event has been entered that needs to be edited or removed from your page, you should contact the uploader of the event. See \u201cWorking with Other Content Authors\u201d . Instructions On the edit screen for an event, you will see the following fields: All Day Event : indicates that an event takes place all day. If checked, you will not need to fill in the time fields for the event date. Event Date : the date(s) when the event occurs Event occurs multiple times in the specified period : check this box if you are entering an ongoing event such as a plant clinic or hotline that has regular hours over the date range you specified. This will reveal a field where you can enter those hours more specifically. We also recommend that you check the \u201cAll Day Event\u201d box for these events in order to hide the time fields from the event date and prevent confusion. Short Description : a short description of the event Full Description : the full event description Event location fields : The field asks \u201cWhere will this event be held?\u201d If \u201cAt a county office,\u201d then select the county office from the drop-down field that appears. The address field will get automatically filled in. If \u201cAt another non-office location,\u201d type the name of the location into the search field on the map. The address fields below will get automatically filled in. If the address is not yet known or private, type \u201cTo Be Determined\u201d or \u201cTo be provided to registrants\u201d in the location name. Then enter the city, state, and ZIP code. If \u201cOnline-only,\u201d no address needs to be provided. Room/building number : include if needed Troubleshooting Tip : If you change an event from an existing location to a custom address, the old location may still show when you save. To correct this: For the field \u201cWhere will this event be held?\u201d select \u201cAt a county office.\u201d Change the drop-down list to --None-- which unsets the existing location. Click the \u201cAt another non-office location\u201d button and enter the new address. Save. Event Cost : how much it costs to attend the event Registration Link : a link to register for the event online. If you enter the link here, you don\u2019t need to enter it in the description. Contact name, email, and phone : person to contact with questions about the event. This information is required by OSU\u2019s calendar system, which pulls events from the Extension website. More information or promotional flyer : uploaded flyer or registration form for the event Important Note: For accessibility, it is important that any information in a flyer is also included in another field on the event (e.g., in the full description field). See Accessibility . Thumbnail : an image for the event Additional calendar : used to export events to other calendars and create narrowed-down event lists on program and county pages Additional counties or programs : other counties and programs where the event should show. You don\u2019t need to include the county or program you are using to enter the event. Topics : specifies which topic pages the event should show on. How and Where It Displays Event teasers will only display on pages until the event ends. They contain the event title, dates, and the city in which it takes place (or \u201cOnline\u201d if it is a webinar). They show on the following pages on the site: Topic pages: events tagged with the topic in the \u201cTopics, Programs, and Counties\u201d section of the edit screen Program pages: events entered by the program\u2019s group or tagged with the program in the \u201cTopics, Programs and Counties\u201d section of the edit screen. County pages: events entered by the county\u2019s group or tagged with the county in the \u201cTopics, Programs, and Counties\u201d section of the edit screen. County subpages: Members of a county group can set up event lists on subpages that only show a subset of events for that county. These events must be: added through the county group or tagged with that county, and tagged with a specified additional calendar. All Extension events will be automatically exported to OSU\u2019s main calendar, Localist . Some important notes about this process: Localist pulls events from the Extension website each night. It pulls both new events and updates to existing events. Uploaded flyers or other documents on the event will only display on the Extension website, not Localist. If you delete an event before it is over (e.g., if you noticed it was a duplicate), it will show as \u201ccancelled\u201d in Localist. The FNR Extension website pulls events from the Extension website when \u201cForestry Extension\u201d is selected under \u201cadditional calendars.\u201d Newsletter Issue What It Is Newsletter issues can be documents, links to an email newsletter service, or content entered into the website. They are organized into newsletter containers. For example the GROWING newsletter container includes the issues for Nov/Dec, Sept/Oct, July/Aug, etc. Who Can Add It Any user can add newsletter issues. However, you must enter an issue of a newsletter through the same group as the newsletter it belongs to. Instructions Step 1: Create the Newsletter Container The first time you upload a newsletter, you will need to create a container to hold all the issues together. To do this, go to the edit screen for a Newsletter Issue. Then click the \u201ccreate a Newsletter container\u201d link under the dropdown list of available newsletters. Step 2: Create Issues for the Newsletter On the edit screen for a newsletter issue, you will see the following fields: Title : a title distinguishing it from other Issues (e.g. \u201cGROWING: May - June 2018\u201d) Associated Newsletter : the newsletter to which this issue belongs Troubleshooting Tip : If the newsletter you want isn\u2019t in the list, one of two things is happening: you aren\u2019t adding the issue through the group the newsletter belongs to, or the newsletter hasn\u2019t been created yet. Issue Type : \u201cWeb Content,\u201d \u201cFile Upload,\u201d or \u201cLink to Issue\u201d File Upload Issues: This type of issue consists of a document uploaded to the website. When you choose this option, you will see a file upload field. Linked Issues: This type of issue consists of a page or document hosted on another website. This includes newsletters sent via MailChimp or in Box. When you choose this option, you will see a field to enter the URL of the issue. Web Content Issues: This type of issue consists of content entered into the website. When you choose this option, the newsletter issue acts like a subpage. See Page Sections for information about adding and arranging content on the page. Short Description : the Table of Contents or description of what visitors can find in this issue. Author and publishing information : Previous issues are arranged based on the \u201cDate Published or Revised\u201d entered here. If the content\u2019s author is an OSU Extension employee, start typing their name into the first \u201cAuthor(s)\u201d field and select them when they come up. This will associate the content with their profile on the site. If the content\u2019s author is not an OSU Extension employee (including OSU employees who don\u2019t have an Extension appointment), enter their information in the \u201cNon-Extension Author(s)\u201d fields. Quick Tip : Web visitors often scan content on the web to see if it is useful for what they need. Make your newsletter content more readable by using these accessibility and writing for the web tips. How and Where It Displays Newsletter containers display automatically on topic and program pages based on their tags. They can also be added to topic landing pages, program pages, and county pages by adding a \u201cFeatured Content\u201d or \u201cFeatured Resources\u201d section. Newsletter issues display in a list on a single page for their Newsletter container. Displaying Newsletter Sign-Up Forms If you have a form people can use to sign up for your newsletter, there are several ways to display it on the site. On the edit screen for the Newsletter container, there is a field for a \u201csubscribe link.\u201d You can enter a link to the form and it will display above the list of the issues for that newsletter. If you want to add a link to the form on a program or county page, you can add a \u201cbutton link\u201d on the desired page. See the Subpage section below for more information. MailChimp and other email management systems often give you an embed code so you can display the sign-up form directly on a web page. Here are instructions for how to get an embed code from MailChimp. Once you have the embed code, add a \u201cText\u201d section to the page. Click the \u201cSource\u201d button in the text editor to switch to HTML mode and paste the embed code there. You will see the form on the page when you click \u201cSave.\u201d Online Resource What It Is A link to educational content housed on another site. Use this for any content that is copyrighted by another organization. Who Can Add It Members of Content Team groups Instructions On the edit screen of an online resource, you will see the following fields: Title : the title of the resource Website URL : the link to the resource Short Description : a description of the resource Thumbnail : an image to go with the resource. If empty, it will use a default image based on the tagged topic. Topics, Keywords, Programs, and Regions : see below Author and Publishing Information : information about the content for future maintenance If the content\u2019s author is an OSU Extension employee, start typing their name into the first \u201cAuthor(s)\u201d field and select them when they come up. This will associate the content with their profile on the site. If the content\u2019s author is not an OSU Extension employee (including OSU employees who don\u2019t have an Extension appointment), enter their information in the \u201cNon-Extension Author(s)\u201d fields. How and Where It Displays The tags in the \u201cTopics, Keywords, Programs, and Regions\u201d section of the edit screen determine where the online resource displays. Topic : it will show in the \u201cBrowse All Resources\u201d page for the specified topic(s) Program : If the specified program has added a \u201cProgram Tagged Content List\u201d section to one of its pages, it will show up there. See the Subpage section for more information. Counties and Programs can add online resources to a page by adding a \u201cfeatured content\u201d section. Program What It Is A program on the Extension website is an externally facing activity that members of the public can participate in. Examples include 4-H programs and the various Master training programs. This definition is narrower than what people in Extension normally mean by \u201cprogram.\u201d It\u2019s not an industry-focused program, informational center program, or Extension program area. These can be highlighted in projects, topic pages, or county \u201cfocus areas,\u201d which is a new content type coming in early 2019. Program Project Topic Page - Public participation or local engagement is a key component. - Web content updates regularly and participants need to access it frequently. - Extension activity with impact or outputs that are of interest to the public. - Often includes partnership with external organizations. - May seek input from the public (e.g., a survey), offer courses, or provide targeted information, but not ongoing participation. - Ongoing high-level activity area such as \u201cDairy Extension\u201d or \u201cFire Program.\u201d - Experts collaborating in working groups that develop educational materials. - May also include events, projects, and participatory programs. Most programs have a single main \u201cstatewide\u201d program group that maintains content. Counties can point visitors there and add some locally relevant information if applicable. However, some programs (namely, 4-H and Master Gardener) have dedicated staff for maintaining specific local content. These have local program groups in addition to the statewide program group. Who Can Add It These have been set up for you. No one can add or delete them. Instructions The edit screen for a program has three sections: Landing Page : This is where you control the content on the program\u2019s landing page. It acts like a subpage. See the Subpage section of this chapter for more information. Sidebar : You can add additional links to the sidebar on program pages. These will show up on every page associated with the program. Program Info : This is where you can edit the description, thumbnail image (photo or square graphic companion logo that has been approved by OSU), tags, and other information for the program. Quick Tip : Members of program groups can feature educational content entered by Content Teams on their pages. See: Organizing and Displaying Content on Other Pages . If your program has an existing website, you can enter the link in the \u201cProgram Info\u201d section of the edit page. Visitors will go directly to this site when they click on the program. If you would like to have a short description about the program, show faculty or staff, and add events or newsletters to show here and other places on the Extension website, before directing people to the external site, do not add the link to the \u201cProgram Info\u201d section. Instead hyperlink to it on the program landing page using a \u201cButton Link\u201d section. How and Where It Displays There is a list of all programs on the programs page . This is in the top black menu bar at the top of every page under \u201cGet Involved.\u201d You can tag a program with topics and counties in the \u201cProgram Info\u201d section of the edit screen. This will create a link to the program on the landing pages of the specified counties and on the Get Involved menu on the specified topic pages. Program Resource What It Is A document or link that is necessary for participation in a program (see definition of program above). Examples include forms, policies, or procedures. These should be items that are only of interest to participants in a specific program . It is very important that educational materials that are useful to the general public NOT be entered as program resources but rather another content type through a Content Team group. Program resources are only seen and needed by participants in a program, and so are more difficult for a general audience to find. Who Can Add It Members of Program groups Instructions On the edit screen for a program resource, you will see the following fields: Resource Type : Selecting \u201cExternal Website\u201d will provide a field for you to enter a URL. Selecting \u201cDocument\u201d will provide a field for uploading a document. You can also specify alternate versions of the file. This is for documents that are available in multiple formats (e.g. PDF, Word) or languages. The different versions are differentiated by the names you give them when you upload them. Example of a program resource with multiple file versions. Description : a description of the resource that displays in the teaser Type : This field is for organizational purposes and will not affect how the program resource displays to visitors to the site. If none fit, select \u201cOther.\u201d Category : To organize program resources, you can configure categories for them (see below). This resource is for active program volunteers : This is for internal informational purposes only. In the future, it could be used to pull information into a volunteer management solution Extension may adopt. Thumbnail : an image for the resource that displays in the teaser. If empty and the resource type is \u201cdocument,\u201d it will use an image of the first page of the document. Quick Tip : If you will need to replace a program resource document with a new version in the future, consider taking advantage of the file versioning functionality available in Box. See: File Management for more information. Managing Program Resource Categories To tag a program resource with categories, you must first create the categories. Categories are program specific. Every program group (including local program groups) has its own set of categories. To add or edit a category, go to the Group Content page for the group the resource is in. Click the \u201cCategories\u201d link at the top of the page. This will take you to a page with a list of available categories. It also shows how many resources are tagged with each category and how many page sections are set up to display that category. When you add or edit a category, you can enter both a name and a description. These are only visible on edit screens and won\u2019t show publicly to visitors to the site. Where and How It Displays Program Resources display in \u201cProgram Resource List\u201d sections on program subpages. These are sorted alphabetically by default, but you can customize the order. See the Subpage section below for more information. Local programs can display program resources from their statewide program. To do this, add a \u201cProgram Statewide Resource List\u201d section to a page. You can narrow the resources shown by the categories configured by the statewide program.

Instructions The edit screen for a subpage contains fields for the page title, hero image, and some basic text content. The hero image displays as a banner at the top of the page, so it should be about 2000px wide by 400px high. If this is empty, it will use the hero image of the county or program in its group. Content for subpages is primarily added through page sections (see Page Sections for more information). These types of sections are available to all subpages: Button Link : a link to another page (in or outside of the Extension site) styled as a large orange button Call to Action : a link to another page (in or outside of the Extension site) that includes a description and image Featured Content : links to content in the Extension site Image : an image with optional caption and alternative text to describe the photo Quick links bar : an orange bar across the page that can contain links to social media or important pages Text : a simple text box with formatting such as bold or italic Text with background : a text section with a background image that stretches all the way across the page.

If there are no program resources with the specified category, the program resource list will not show up and the \u201ctitle\u201d and \u201cdescription\u201d will stay invisible to the public. If you want the description text to be visible on the Subpage regardless, it\u2019s best to use a \u201cText\u201d section instead. By default, resources are sorted alphabetically. You can reorder the resources in a list by hovering over the list, clicking the pencil icon that appears to the right of the title, and selecting \u201cReorder items.\u201d This will take you to a page where you can drag and drop the resources into the order you want.

To nest one or more pages under another, drag the nested page to the right and you\u2019ll see it slightly indented. You can do this for as many menu pages as you would like, but only one level down. If you want a page to no longer be nested, drag it back to the left. Note that sidebars contain some automatically generated pages at the top, above the listed subpages, that cannot be reordered. You can add links to external sites, such as a college or association site, to the bottom of the sidebar. To do this, edit the program or county the sidebar belongs to. Open the \u201cSidebar\u201d tab on the edit screen and click the \u201cAdd Button Link\u201d button. Topic Page What It Is A \u201ctopic page\u201d actually consists of several pages, which are listed in a menu across the top of the landing page: Landing Page (\u201chome\u201d for the topic) : the first page visitors see when they click on a topic. Here is a list of what this page itself consists of (items marked with a \u201c*\u201d are customizable by topic committees): Hero image* : large image across the top of the page Short description* : one or two sentences about the topic and the work Extension does relating to it Resource lists* : can be configured as needed About section* : more in-depth information about the topic and Extension\u2019s work, optionally with a large background image Explore more resources* : links to other topic pages that contain content that may be of interest to visitors Upcoming events : the three closest upcoming events tagged with the topic Meet our experts* : if experts are selected by the topic committee, they will display here.

Quick Tip : For guidelines to help decide what content to feature on a Topic Page, Planning and Evaluating Content . Who Can Add It Topics are set up by the EESC web team. No one can add or delete a topic, but topic committee members are able to edit certain sections of the landing page. If you have content that doesn\u2019t fit into an existing topic, you can request a new one for consideration. The following criteria are used to determine whether something should be a topic on the site: There is a reasonable amount of content for the topic At least one content team is associated with the topic User feedback or other data supports the need for the topic The topic has a user-friendly label, meaning: it is appropriate for its audience (e.g., if the content is generally targeted or industry targeted), and there evidence that web visitors understand and use the term. Other Content Teams that have entered or would enter content for the topic have been consulted and are willing to help with retagging content from their group. You can request a new topic by submitting a support request . The educational content that shows on topic pages is entered by content teams. A single topic page may showcase content from multiple content teams, and a single content team may enter content for multiple topics. Topic Committee groups are responsible for featuring content on topic pages. See Getting Started with Content - Topic Committees for more information. Instructions On the edit screen for a topic landing page, you will see the following fields: Hero image : the large image across the top of the page. Please use an image that is at least 2000px wide and 325px tall. When uploading an image, please be sure to set the \u201c focal point \u201d so it will display properly on all screen sizes.

Please use an image at least 2000px wide and tall enough to be a backdrop to the text you write. Remember to set the focal point when uploading it. Landing page sections : You can add two different types of sections to the page: Custom topic section : a section title (e.g., \u201cFeatured Resources\u201d), several pieces of manually selected content, and a manually entered link to see more content. A good option here is to use a link to the topic\u2019s \u201cBrowse Resources\u201d page with one or more filters already applied. Examples may be specific subtopics such as \u201cNutrients\u201d or audiences such as \u201cCoastal Region.\u201d More than one Custom topic section can be added to highlight frequently looked for categories. Latest topic content : the newest three pieces of content tagged with the topic. It can be narrowed by content type to, for example, show only the newest three videos or Extension Catalog publications. More than one of these sections can be added. Featured experts : Enter the ONID usernames (not full names) of the people to show in the \u201cMeet Our Experts\u201d section. If none are selected, the first four people in alphabetical order with their \u201cExpertise\u201d set to the topic will show up.

Your groups determine what content you can enter and edit in the Extension website. Options on Where to Put the Content All content that is going to be included in Extension\u2019s digital strategy going forward must be entered in the Extension website. This includes most, but not all, of Extension\u2019s existing web content. However, the Extension website is not a good place for: Extension faculty and staff resources Historical documents or reference materials. Use Box or archive as appropriate. Content that needs work. Content should conform to the website\u2019s guiding principles, described in the introduction to this guide. Before adding content to the new site, review and/or revise to ensure accuracy. Revise or redesign to ensure it is on brand. Volunteer resources. A separate website solution is being discussed. For now, a combination of the Extension website and Box is a likely solution. When your team is ready to add volunteer content, please let us know. Together, we can decide on the best short-term solution. There are several options for content that doesn't go on the Extension website. See Getting Help if you need help choosing the best method for your content.

OSU WordPress Blog Content that isn\u2019t for a broad number of external visitors Anything that should be included in the digital strategy going forward; content for a general external audience Scholars Archive Historical documents and research EESC is responsible for archiving Extension catalog publications. Library Archive Websites that are historical (no longer maintained) Drupal Groups Your groups assigned in the Drupal content management system (CMS) determine what content you are allowed to edit. When someone in your a group creates a piece of content, you and anyone in your that group can edit it. If someone adds content in a group you are not a member of, you can\u2019t edit it. Similarly, a person can\u2019t edit content that belongs to a group they are not part of. When you are a member of a group, the type of group determines what type of content you can add. There are four types of groups on the site. Content Team Program Team County Office Team Topic Committee (representatives from different content teams) A person may be a member of several groups with different group types, so it is important to understand what content belongs in what group. Content Teams Content teams are responsible for entering educational content, including region specific content . They can also add events and newsletters if not already added by another team. Content entered by Content Teams primarily displays on topic pages on the Extension website (e.g. the Dairy topic page). A single content team may enter content for multiple topics. Likewise, a single topic page may show content entered by multiple groups. Program Groups Program groups are responsible for entering materials that visitors need to join or participate in their program (e.g. Master Woodland Managers) . On the Extension website, they can also feature educational content entered by a Content Team that is especially relevant to members of their program or point people to the relevant topic pages. Program groups do not represent the seven Extension program areas, institutes, centers, nor industry/discipline programs. They are ways for the public to get involved in programming like Master Beekeeper or Walk with Ease. For most programs, a single statewide group enters content (e.g. Better Bones and Balance). However, programs that differ significantly by county may have a separate group for each of their local programs (e.g. Benton County 4-H). This also requires having enough county-based staff to support content maintenance. Program teams will enter most of their content as \u201cprogram resources\u201d. Each of these represents an individual form, file, or link. They can organize these on \u201csubpages\u201d on the Extension website. Program groups can also enter events, newsletters, and announcements that are of interest to members of their program. County Office Groups County office groups are responsible for entering content about their office\u2019s physical location and services provided, highlighting the activities going on at the office, and directing visitors to relevant educational and program content . This also includes the combined stations. County office groups can create events and newsletters. They can also set up \u201ccounty focus areas\u201d on the Extension website. These serve as a link between the county and a topic or program that is of particular interest to visitors from that county. For example, a county on the coast could describe their work with coastal issues and link to educational content about marine wildlife. Combined stations will also be linked to the research pages on the College of Agricultural Sciences website for agricultural experiment and combined stations. Topic Committees Topic Committees are responsible for deciding what content to feature on the topic page they are in charge of (e.g. Beef Cattle). This may involve: identifying the various audiences the topic is aimed at and their questions highlighting high quality, important, or seasonally relevant content for that topic setting up keyword standards for content in that topic establishing a content schedule for the topic page content They may also write some text for topic pages that describes Extension\u2019s work in a particular area. As a committee, they do not enter pieces of content themselves. Most members of topic committees will also be members of a content team. However, it is not necessary to be on a content team (or any other group) to be on a topic committee. Types of groups and how they overlap. Case Study: Groups for a Master Gardener Coordinator Say that in county X, there is a single person that acts as a Master Gardener volunteer coordinator. This employee develops educational materials as well as forms and other materials for volunteers. This person would be a member of (at least) two groups. The \u201cHome Horticulture\u201d content team: They would use this group to enter their educational gardening content, since gardening information is relevant to people outside the program too, not just participants. The \u201cMaster Gardener \u2013 X County\u201d program team: They would use this group to enter the program materials for Master Gardeners in their county. They could also display educational content that their volunteers would find useful. Content Types As mentioned in the introduction to this guide, it is important that content have structure for Extension\u2019s digital strategy to work. A content type is how we structure a piece of content. Examples on the Extension website are articles, events, newsletters, and videos. Each content type has different fields to fill out when entering it. The content types that you are able to use depend on the group type you are using.

It has become obvious that there is no one best way to reach Extension\u2019s audiences. Today, people get information from social media, smartphone apps, Google searches, smart home devices, and more. In the future, these channels will vary even more widely. We can be certain that as technology develops, the ways people use it will constantly change. If Extension hopes to engage a wide audience and remain relevant, it needs digital content that is flexible and adaptive to these changes. Oregon State University Extension has developed a digital strategy to meet this need. This project aligns with similar initiatives in other colleges and organizations within OSU as well as the University itself. The University\u2019s Strategic Plan 4.0 includes goals such as: \u201c[deliver] distinctive and affordable education via multiple pathways\u201d, \u201cretool the OSU experience for the 21st century learner\u201d, \u201ccoordinate marketing and communications across onsite, digital, and hybrid learning platforms\u201d, and \u201cintegrate and simplify technology systems, data practices and policies to increase our organizational agility.\u201d All of these goals align with Extension\u2019s new digital strategy. Extension\u2019s digital strategy consists of two high-level objectives: Create a central \u201ccontent management system\u201d (CMS) for digital content that can provide a variety of feeds to devices and platforms. Implement a \u201ccustomer relationship management\u201d (CRM) system to deliver content in a personalized way. Content Management System The traditional way digital content is served vs. Extension\u2019s new digital strategy. A content management system (or CMS) is a system that works like a database for content. Currently, we populate our CMS by entering content into the new Extension website. A CMS contains the content itself as well as information about the content such as its author and what it\u2019s about. It can then feed the content to many different \"channels,\u201d including websites, social media feeds, smartphone apps, and smart home devices. The goal behind a central CMS is to meet people where they are instead of trying to force them to come to us. To create a CMS that can fulfill this goal, our way of thinking about the content we enter needs to change. In particular, content in the new system needs to have the following characteristics: Centralized : All content delivered by the CMS needs to be entered and stored in one place. Structured : For diverse platforms to be able to parse content in useful ways, the content needs to have structure. Instead of putting a bunch of content in one text box on a page, it is better to organize that data into fields. Atomic : \"Atomic\" means \u201cof or forming a single irreducible unit or component in a larger system.\u201d This means that we want to enter content in the system as the smallest possible (and sensible) pieces. Then the system can put them back together in different ways depending on the context. Described : Computers are getting \u201csmarter\u201d all the time, but they always do better with a little human help. Authors should include information about the content in the system. This gives clues as to what the content is about, who it is for, and when it is appropriate to present. Case Study: Home Food Safety and Preservation Program Publications On the previous Extension website, this program created a page for its publications. Each publication is a PDF file containing information about a food preservation topic, and each PDF was a link on the page. Instead of adding them all to the CMS as one long page of links like on the old site, content managers for the program entered each publication separately. Now the website can list them all together for volunteers and present them separately to visitors interested in a specific subject. Also, if authors need to update information, then they just need to change the publication once. It will be updated everywhere it shows on the site, which avoids broken links and reduces workload. Customer Relationship Management The next phase of the digital strategy initiative will be to develop a customer relationship management (or CRM) system. A CRM system allows an organization to record a person\u2019s interactions with them. In Extension\u2019s case, this may include event registrations, newsletter subscriptions, financial contributions, and content viewed on our website. A CRM system will allow us to interact with web-based learners and clients in a more constructive way. Previously, Extension presented content to visitors with little opportunity for conversation, feedback, or follow-up. Our new digital strategy will give Extension educators opportunities to build relationships through the web. Extension will use Salesforce to be compatible with other groups across the university using it. This project is still in the early stages, but at this time, our priorities are to: hire a Salesforce programmer to develop and implement the software; provide a personalized digital experience to our clients that is relevant to their needs and interests and timely and accessible; meet high standards of security and privacy; and ensure that our clients are comfortable with their experience. The New Extension Website The new Extension website that the public and our participants see is just one way people will get content from Extension. Content entered into the website populates Extension\u2019s CMS. This will eventually also feed information out through social media, emails, and other technology. The new Extension website was created in order to update our web platform according to the University\u2019s policies. To follow the new digital strategy, the site was built with several guiding principles in mind. Customer focused . The new website follows known customer preferences and bases menus and navigation on what customers want to do, learn, or search for, not on an internal topic or label. Mobile friendly . The new website employs layouts and content that can be delivered in mobile-friendly ways. Data informed . We use analytics and other data (e.g., needs assessments, trends) to support decisions. Relevant . The site is built so content can be easily updated frequently. It implements processes that create less work for people, are easier with appropriate training, and are managed at the right level. Content focused . It's about the content, not about the sites. The goal is to integrate or transition relevant content into the CMS rather than develop, host, or manage individual sites. Practical . The new website allows faculty and staff to focus on content rather than website design, development, and management. The right people are doing the right things. In June 2018, the new Extension website was launched as a minimum viable product. This means that not all features and design work was included that will be in the final product. Since launch, we have been collecting data and feedback and implementing improvements and new functionality. The first round of these improvements is underway and will be complete in early 2019. Review of Terms Content Management System (CMS): a centralized source of content that feeds data to a variety of platforms, including the new Extension website Fields : individual pieces of data that make up content. For example, a person\u2019s faculty/staff profile would contain separate fields for their name, phone number, email address, etc. Customer Relationship Management (CRM) System : a system that records the interaction between an individual and an organization, and maintains a database of contacts. It connects with the CMS and other tools to get relevant information to audiences. New Extension website : the first of what will be many facets of Extension\u2019s digital strategy. The content going into the Extension website will, in the future, also appear in other places (e.g. social media, email). This will be possible due to the way the content is entered and the existence of a content management system. Key Takeaways Extension\u2019s digital strategy will make our content available to clients that access information online in a variety of ways. Content entered into the new Extension Website goes into a \u201ccontent management system\u201d that will feed into many channels. In order for this to be effective, content needs to be structured, atomic, and described. The next phase in the digital strategy initiative will be to implement a \u201cCustomer Relationship Management\u201d system.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"intro/#introduction-extensions-digital-strategy","text":"The ways people seek and use information online are more diverse than ever. It has become obvious that there is no one best way to reach Extension\u2019s audiences. Today, people get information from social media, smartphone apps, Google searches, smart home devices, and more. In the future, these channels will vary even more widely. We can be certain that as technology develops, the ways people use it will constantly change. If Extension hopes to engage a wide audience and remain relevant, it needs digital content that is flexible and adaptive to these changes.

Browsing the Website Every person uses the Internet with their own methods and style. Each of us reads, clicks, and searches differently. To support these differences and the preferences of our diverse Extension audience, the website provides multiple ways to find content: searching for content; finding content by browsing a topic-based menu; finding content through a participant-based program; and finding content through a county location. Search Research shows that more than half of all web users primarily use a site\u2019s search functionality to find content. Many visitors who start with menus and links switch to search if they can\u2019t find the content they want. The search box at the top of every page of the Extension website searches all content on the site. Improving search results There are two methods for a visitor to get more specific or relevant search results. Refine the search . The screenshot below shows the search results when you search for \u201capples.\u201d The top results are information about apple trees and their care. If you want information about preserving apples, you can change the search to \u201cpreserving apples.\u201d This would give more relevant results. Analytics show that about 30% of people who use search on the site \u201crefine\u201d their searches. Use the filters in the left sidebar of the search results page. The visitor in the previous example could open the \u201cFilter by Topic\u201d section and select \u201cHome Food Preservation.\u201d This will show only search results tagged with the topic \u201cHome Food Preservation.\u201d Screenshot showing the results when a visitor searches for \u201capples.\u201d Screenshot showing the results when a visitor searches for \u201capples\u201d and then filters results to show only items tagged with \u201cHome Food Preservation.\u201d Topic-Based Navigation The primary place for visitors to find educational content is on topic pages. This is because analytics and user testing show that people looking for educational content tend to use topic-based navigation first. To get to the topic pages, click \u201cTopics\u201d in the black navigation bar at the top of every page. There are also links to topics on the home page. Each topic has a \u201clanding page\u201d that is semi-curated by topic committees. This page contains the most important content for the topic and a description of the work Extension is doing in that area. It also links to several other pages that contain more content related to the topic. The visitor can click on a link on the landing page to go to the \u201cBrowse Resources\u201d page for that topic. This page lists in chronological order all content in the system tagged with the topic. Like the search result page, filters on this page narrow the list to content relevant to the visitor. The resources page for the \u201cDairy\u201d topic shows all content tagged with the topic. Note the filters in the left sidebar that allow users to narrow the content they see on this page. Program-Based Navigation Visitors can find content related to an Extension program they are involved in through that program\u2019s pages. There are a few ways to get to these pages. The home page lists programs that bring a lot of people to the site. Topic pages list programs that are related to that topic. County pages list programs that are active in that county. All programs are listed on a page in the top black menu bar under \u201cGet Involved.\u201d All program content can be found through the site\u2019s search. The program groups that maintain these pages have a lot of flexibility around how they can present content. For more information, see: Adding and Editing Content: Subpages and Organizing and Displaying Content on Other Pages . Location-Based Navigation Many visitors familiar with the old website expect to find content on their county\u2019s page. Counties, like programs, maintain pages to organize and direct visitors toward content. People can find their county on the \u201cLocations\u201d page under \u201cFind Us\u201d in the top black menu bar. Case Study: Finding a Newsletter A newsletter called GROWING is published in Linn and Benton Counties. A person might find this newsletter on the Extension site in several ways. Search for \u201cgrowing\u201d and filter by Type \u201cNewsletter.\u201d Search for \u201cgrowing newsletter.\u201d Use the link on the Linn-Benton Master Gardener program page. Use the link on the Linn County page. Use the link on the Benton County page. Use the link on the \u201cBrowse Resources\u201d page for the Gardening Techniques topic. Since the newsletter was entered only once, updates will automatically show up in all these places. Making Changes to Content To make changes to content, content authors , people who enter content, must log in to the site. There is a \u201cLog in\u201d link at the bottom right of every page. This will take you to a screen where you use your ONID credentials to log in. When you are logged in, you will see a \u201cMy Groups\u201d link in the top black menu bar on every page. There are three pages to understand in order to use the back-end: the \u201cMy Groups\u201d page, the \u201cGroup Content\u201d page, and the \u201cEdit Screen.\u201d My Groups Page When you log in (or click on the \u201cMy Groups\u201d menu link), you will see your \u201cMy Groups Page.\u201d This page lists your groups. Your groups determine what types of content you can add and which pieces of content you have access to edit. My Groups Page example. If you need to be part of a group that isn\u2019t listed on your \u201cMy Groups\u201d page, get in touch with the leader of that group. See \u201cWorking with Other Content Authors\u201d for more information. Group Content Page Clicking on one of the group names will take you to the \u201c Group Content Page \u201d for that group. This page lists all the content that belongs to that group. Any member of the group can add and edit content for that group. The different types of content you can add to the group are listed as buttons across the top of the page. Group Content Page example. Edit Screen You will see the edit screen when adding or editing a piece of content. You can get to the edit screen in several ways: On the Group Content Page, find the content you want to edit and click the \u201cEdit\u201d button. Navigate to the desired page and click the \u201cEdit\u201d tab just under the title. To create a new piece of content, click one of the \u201cAdd\u201d buttons at the top of the Group Content page. How the edit page will look will vary by the type of content. Each are described in Adding and Editing Content . Edit Screen example. Using Edit Fields There are a couple of controls on edit screens that are important. Text Editor This field is used to enter text. Buttons at the top allow you to format the text. The \u201cFormat\u201d dropdown is for creating headings. You can also view the HTML for the text with the \u201cSource\u201d button. Use the buttons for only their intended purpose. For example, don\u2019t use headings to merely make text bigger or add emphasis. Similarly, don\u2019t use the subscript or superscript button to make text smaller. See the Accessibility section later in this guide for more information. Links To add a link , type and highlight the text you want to use as the link label and click the button in the text editor that looks like a chain link. This will open a small window. There are several ways to enter a link: To link to content that already exists on the site, start typing the name of the content. Matching titles will appear. Select the content you want to link to. To link to external content, copy and paste the URL. To link to an email address, enter \u201cmailto:(email address).\u201d To link to a specific section on the current page or another page, paste in the URL and add \u201c#(section-id)\u201d to the end. See Page Sections for more information. You can edit a link by placing your cursor inside the link and clicking on the link icon in the text editor. The same window will pop up where you can edit the link. When you create links in the text editor, it is very important that you periodically check that the links still work . Broken links on a website hurt an organization\u2019s credibility and might result in a penalty from search engines like Google, making content harder to find. We recommend using dynamically generated page sections, such as featured content or program tagged content lists, for linking to other content on the site when possible. These will automatically update when the content\u2019s link changes and so will never break. See Adding and Editing Content: Subpages for more information. Image, Document, and Video Browsers For fields that allow you to upload an image or document or embed a video, you will see a button that says \u201cSelect Image\u201d, \u201cSelect Document\u201d, or \u201cSelect Video\u201d (i.e, when uploading an image, it will say \u201cSelect image\u201d). Clicking this button will open a new window called the image/document/video browser (depending on what you are uploading). Image browser. The browser consists of two tabs: Upload new : This is where you can upload a new file. After selecting the file from your computer (or entering a video embed URL), you will need to enter some additional information. Image : There are a number of fields you can fill out for an image. Alternative text : If there is text in the image, re-enter it here so that assistive technology and search engines can read it. See Captions and Alternative Text for more information. Caption : Enter any additional information about the image that is useful to visitors here (not in the Alternative text field). Keep in mind that this photo may be reused for other purposes in the future. Photo credit and photo credit link : See Using Images for more information. Don\u2019t allow reuse : This prevents others from using the image in other places. Use this if there is limited permissions to use the image. If the photo can be reused, consider making the file name descriptive so it\u2019s easier to search for in the future. Document : Provide a document name. This may be seen by the public, so use something that makes sense. Video : Provide a video name.This is not seen by the public. Reuse existing : If you or someone else has already uploaded the file you want to use, you can reuse it without having to re-enter the information. Search by the filename of the existing item or the name it was given when originally uploaded. When you find it, click the checkbox next to it. Then click the \u201cSelect\u201d button at the bottom of the window. Save the page for the selection to take effect. Content Browser For fields that allow you to reference an existing piece of content, you will see a button that says \u201cSelect Content.\u201d Clicking this button will open a new window called the content browser . Content browser. You can search for existing content by title, content type, group, topic, and/or author. When you find the content you want to use, click the checkbox next to it. Then click the \u201cFinish\u201d button at the bottom of the window. Save the page for the selection to take effect. Page Sections When adding or editing certain kinds of content, including program and county pages, projects, and web-based newsletters, you will need to manage content on the page via page sections . With this method, you add pieces of content to the page in chunks, one section at a time. There are several different types of sections you can use for different kinds of content on the page. Some sections are for basic page elements such as text and images. Others create dynamic lists that pull content onto the page. These include county or program events lists (which pull events) and program resource lists (which pull program resources). Once you set up one of these sections, it will automatically show new content as it is entered without you needing to update the page. The types of page sections available depend on the type of content you are working on. See Adding and Editing Content for details about the type of sections available for each type. You add page sections using the buttons at the bottom of the edit screen. Buttons to add page sections to a program page. You can reorder them by dragging them up and down the page using the arrow controls. For Advanced Users: Page Section Settings for Custom Design In the edit screen just above where you add and arrange page sections, there is a tab for \u201cSettings\u201d: When you switch to this tab, you will see the extra settings available for each section. The current available settings are: Section ID : This allows you to link to a specific section on a page. The ID should be a short, unique name with no spaces or punctuation besides dashes (-) or underscores (_). When you give a section an ID, you can link directly to that section by adding \u201c#SECTION_ID\u201d to the end of the subpage\u2019s URL. Background color : You can select a background color for the section that stretches all the way across the screen. The options are white or gray. \u201cCall to Action\u201d sections can also be black or orange. List style : For sections that display content in a list (e.g. featured content and program resources lists), you can select the style to display each piece of content. You can choose between \u201cList,\u201d \u201cGrid,\u201d or \u201cText List\u201d (see below). \u201cList\u201d style. \u201cGrid\u201d style. \u201cText List\u201d style.
