It has become obvious that there is no one best way to reach Extension\u2019s audiences. Today, people get information from social media, smartphone apps, Google searches, smart home devices, and more. In the future, these channels will vary even more widely. We can be certain that as technology develops, the ways people use it will constantly change. If Extension hopes to engage a wide audience and remain relevant, it needs digital content that is flexible and adaptive to these changes. Oregon State University Extension has developed a digital strategy to meet this need. This project aligns with similar initiatives in other colleges and organizations within OSU as well as the University itself. The University\u2019s Strategic Plan 4.0 includes goals such as: - \u201c[deliver] distinctive and affordable education via multiple pathways\u201d, - \u201cretool the OSU experience for the 21st century learner\u201d, - \u201ccoordinate marketing and communications across onsite, digital, and hybrid learning platforms\u201d, and - \u201cintegrate and simplify technology systems, data practices and policies to increase our organizational agility.\u201d All of these goals align with Extension\u2019s new digital strategy. Extension\u2019s digital strategy consists of two high-level objectives: 1. Create a central \u201ccontent management system\u201d (CMS) for digital content that can provide a variety of feeds to devices and platforms. 2. Implement a \u201ccustomer relationship management\u201d (CRM) system to deliver content in a personalized way. Content Management System The traditional way digital content is served vs. Extension\u2019s new digital strategy. A content management system (or CMS) is a system that works like a database for content. Currently, we populate our CMS by entering content into the new Extension website. A CMS contains the content itself as well as information about the content such as its author and what it\u2019s about. It can then feed the content to many different \"channels,\u201d including websites, social media feeds, smartphone apps, and smart home devices. The goal behind a central CMS is to meet people where they are instead of trying to force them to come to us. To create a CMS that can fulfill this goal, our way of thinking about the content we enter needs to change. In particular, content in the new system needs to have the following characteristics: Centralized : All content delivered by the CMS needs to be entered and stored in one place. Structured : For diverse platforms to be able to parse content in useful ways, the content needs to have structure. Instead of putting a bunch of content in one text box on a page, it is better to organize that data into fields. Atomic : \"Atomic\" means \u201cof or forming a single irreducible unit or component in a larger system.\u201d This means that we want to enter content in the system as the smallest possible (and sensible) pieces. Then the system can put them back together in different ways depending on the context. Described : Computers are getting \u201csmarter\u201d all the time, but they always do better with a little human help. Authors should include information about the content in the system. This gives clues as to what the content is about, who it is for, and when it is appropriate to present. Case Study: Home Food Safety and Preservation Program Publications On the previous Extension website, this program created a page for its publications. Each publication is a PDF file containing information about a food preservation topic, and each PDF was a link on the page. Instead of adding them all to the CMS as one long page of links like on the old site, content managers for the program entered each publication separately. Now the website can list them all together for volunteers and present them separately to visitors interested in a specific subject. Also, if authors need to update information, then they just need to change the publication once. It will be updated everywhere it shows on the site, which avoids broken links and reduces workload. Customer Relationship Management The next phase of the digital strategy initiative will be to develop a customer relationship management (or CRM) system. A CRM system allows an organization to record a person\u2019s interactions with them. In Extension\u2019s case, this may include event registrations, newsletter subscriptions, financial contributions, and content viewed on our website. A CRM system will allow us to interact with web-based learners and clients in a more constructive way. Previously, Extension presented content to visitors with little opportunity for conversation, feedback, or follow-up. Our new digital strategy will give Extension educators opportunities to build relationships through the web. Extension will use Salesforce to be compatible with other groups across the university using it. This project is still in the early stages, but at this time, our priorities are to: - hire a Salesforce programmer to develop and implement the software; - provide a personalized digital experience to our clients that is relevant to their needs and interests and timely and accessible; - meet high standards of security and privacy; and - ensure that our clients are comfortable with their experience. The New Extension Website The new Extension website that the public and our participants see is just one way people will get content from Extension. Content entered into the website populates Extension\u2019s CMS. This will eventually also feed information out through social media, emails, and other technology. The new Extension website was created in order to update our web platform according to the University\u2019s policies. To follow the new digital strategy, the site was built with several guiding principles in mind. Customer focused . The new website follows known customer preferences and bases menus and navigation on what customers want to do, learn, or search for, not on an internal topic or label. Mobile friendly . The new website employs layouts and content that can be delivered in mobile-friendly ways. Data informed . We use analytics and other data (e.g., needs assessments, trends) to support decisions. Relevant . The site is built so content can be easily updated frequently. It implements processes that create less work for people, are easier with appropriate training, and are managed at the right level. Content focused . It's about the content, not about the sites. The goal is to integrate or transition relevant content into the CMS rather than develop, host, or manage individual sites. Practical . The new website allows faculty and staff to focus on content rather than website design, development, and management. The right people are doing the right things. In June 2018, the new Extension website was launched as a minimum viable product. This means that not all features and design work was included that will be in the final product. Since launch, we have been collecting data and feedback and implementing improvements and new functionality. The first round of these improvements is underway and will be complete in early 2019. Review of Terms Content Management System (CMS): a centralized source of content that feeds data to a variety of platforms, including the new Extension website Fields : individual pieces of data that make up content. For example, a person\u2019s faculty/staff profile would contain separate fields for their name, phone number, email address, etc. Customer Relationship Management (CRM) System : a system that records the interaction between an individual and an organization, and maintains a database of contacts. It connects with the CMS and other tools to get relevant information to audiences. New Extension website : the first of what will be many facets of Extension\u2019s digital strategy. The content going into the Extension website will, in the future, also appear in other places (e.g. social media, email). This will be possible due to the way the content is entered and the existence of a content management system. Key Takeaways Extension\u2019s digital strategy will make our content available to clients that access information online in a variety of ways. Content entered into the new Extension Website goes into a \u201ccontent management system\u201d that will feed into many channels. In order for this to be effective, content needs to be structured, atomic, and described.

Browsing the Website Every person uses the Internet with their own methods and style. Each of us reads, clicks, and searches differently. To support these differences and the preferences of our diverse Extension audience, the website provides multiple ways to find content: - searching for content; - finding content by browsing a topic-based menu; - finding content through a participant-based program; and - finding content through a county location. Search Research shows that more than half of all web users primarily use a site\u2019s search functionality to find content. Many visitors who start with menus and links switch to search if they can\u2019t find the content they want. The search box at the top of every page of the Extension website searches all content on the site. Improving search results There are two methods for a visitor to get more specific or relevant search results. Refine the search . The screenshot below shows the search results when you search for \u201capples.\u201d The top results are information about apple trees and their care. If you want information about preserving apples, you can change the search to \u201cpreserving apples.\u201d This would give more relevant results. Analytics show that about 30% of people who use search on the site \u201crefine\u201d their searches. Use the filters in the left sidebar of the search results page. The visitor in the previous example could open the \u201cFilter by Topic\u201d section and select \u201cHome Food Preservation.\u201d This will show only search results tagged with the topic \u201cHome Food Preservation.\u201d Screenshot showing the results when a visitor searches for \u201capples.\u201d Screenshot showing the results when a visitor searches for \u201capples\u201d and then filters results to show only items tagged with \u201cHome Food Preservation.\u201d Topic-Based Navigation The primary place for visitors to find educational content is on topic pages. This is because analytics and user testing show that people looking for educational content tend to use topic-based navigation first. To get to the topic pages, click \u201cTopics\u201d in the black navigation bar at the top of every page. There are also links to topics on the home page. Each topic has a \u201clanding page\u201d that is semi-curated by topic committees. This page contains the most important content for the topic and a description of the work Extension is doing in that area. It also links to several other pages that contain more content related to the topic. The visitor can click on a link on the landing page to go to the \u201cBrowse Resources\u201d page for that topic. This page lists in chronological order all content in the system tagged with the topic. Like the search result page, filters on this page narrow the list to content relevant to the visitor. The resources page for the \u201cDairy\u201d topic shows all content tagged with the topic. Note the filters in the left sidebar that allow users to narrow the content they see on this page. Program-Based Navigation Visitors can find content related to an Extension program they are involved in through that program\u2019s pages. There are a few ways to get to these pages. The home page lists programs that bring a lot of people to the site. Topic pages list programs that are related to that topic. County pages list programs that are active in that county. All programs are listed on a page in the top black menu bar under \u201cGet Involved.\u201d All program content can be found through the site\u2019s search. The program groups that maintain these pages have a lot of flexibility around how they can present content. For more information, see: Adding and Editing Content: Subpages and Organizing and Displaying Content on Other Pages . Location-Based Navigation Many visitors familiar with the old website expect to find content on their county\u2019s page. Counties, like programs, maintain pages to organize and direct visitors toward content. People can find their county on the \u201cLocations\u201d page under \u201cFind Us\u201d in the top black menu bar. Case Study: Finding a Newsletter A newsletter called GROWING is published in Linn and Benton Counties. A person might find this newsletter on the Extension site in several ways. - Search for \u201cgrowing\u201d and filter by Type \u201cNewsletter.\u201d - Search for \u201cgrowing newsletter.\u201d - Use the link on the Linn-Benton Master Gardener program page. - Use the link on the Linn County page. - Use the link on the Benton County page. - Use the link on the \u201cBrowse Resources\u201d page for the Gardening Techniques topic. Since the newsletter was entered only once, updates will automatically show up in all these places. Making Changes to Content To make changes to content, content authors , people who enter content, must log in to the site. There is a \u201cLog in\u201d link at the bottom right of every page. This will take you to a screen where you use your ONID credentials to log in. When you are logged in, you will see a \u201cMy Groups\u201d link in the top black menu bar on every page. There are three pages to understand in order to use the back-end: - the \u201cMy Groups\u201d page, - the \u201cGroup Content\u201d page, and - the \u201cEdit Screen.\u201d My Groups Page When you log in (or click on the \u201cMy Groups\u201d menu link), you will see your \u201cMy Groups Page.\u201d This page lists your groups. Your groups determine what types of content you can add and which pieces of content you have access to edit. My Groups Page example. If you need to be part of a group that isn\u2019t listed on your \u201cMy Groups\u201d page, get in touch with the leader of that group. See \u201cWorking with Other Content Authors\u201d for more information. Group Content Page Clicking on one of the group names will take you to the \u201c Group Content Page \u201d for that group. This page lists all the content that belongs to that group. Any member of the group can add and edit content for that group. The different types of content you can add to the group are listed as buttons across the top of the page. Group Content Page example. Edit Screen You will see the edit screen when adding or editing a piece of content. You can get to the edit screen in several ways: On the Group Content Page, find the content you want to edit and click the \u201cEdit\u201d button. Navigate to the desired page and click the \u201cEdit\u201d tab just under the title. To create a new piece of content, click one of the \u201cAdd\u201d buttons at the top of the Group Content page. How the edit page will look will vary by the type of content. Each are described in Adding and Editing Content . Edit Screen example. Using Edit Fields There are a couple of controls on edit screens that are important. Text Editor This field is used to enter text. Buttons at the top allow you to format the text. The \u201cFormat\u201d dropdown is for creating headings. You can also view the HTML for the text with the \u201cSource\u201d button. Use the buttons for only their intended purpose. For example, don\u2019t use headings to merely make text bigger or add emphasis. Similarly, don\u2019t use the subscript or superscript button to make text smaller. See the Accessibility section later in this guide for more information. Links To add a link , type and highlight the text you want to use as the link label and click the button in the text editor that looks like a chain link. This will open a small window. There are several ways to enter a link: - To link to content that already exists on the site, start typing the name of the content. Matching titles will appear. Select the content you want to link to. - To link to external content, copy and paste the URL. - To link to an email address, enter \u201cmailto:(email address).\u201d - To link to a specific section on the current page or another page, paste in the URL and add \u201c#(section-id)\u201d to the end. See Page Sections for more information. You can edit a link by placing your cursor inside the link and clicking on the link icon in the text editor. The same window will pop up where you can edit the link. When you create links in the text editor, it is very important that you periodically check that the links still work . Broken links on a website hurt an organization\u2019s credibility and might result in a penalty from search engines like Google, making content harder to find. We recommend using dynamically generated page sections, such as featured content or program tagged content lists, for linking to other content on the site when possible. These will automatically update when the content\u2019s link changes and so will never break. See Adding and Editing Content: Subpages for more information. Image, Document, and Video Browsers For fields that allow you to upload an image or document or embed a video, you will see a button that says \u201cSelect Image\u201d, \u201cSelect Document\u201d, or \u201cSelect Video\u201d (i.e, when uploading an image, it will say \u201cSelect image\u201d). Clicking this button will open a new window called the image/document/video browser (depending on what you are uploading). Image browser. The browser consists of two tabs: 1. Upload new : This is where you can upload a new file. After selecting the file from your computer (or entering a video embed URL), you will need to enter some additional information. - Image : There are a number of fields you can fill out for an image. - Alternative text : If there is text in the image, re-enter it here so that assistive technology and search engines can read it. See Captions and Alternative Text for more information. - Caption : Enter any additional information about the image that is useful to visitors here (not in the Alternative text field). Keep in mind that this photo may be reused for other purposes in the future. - Photo credit and photo credit link : See Using Images for more information. - Don\u2019t allow reuse : This prevents others from using the image in other places. Use this if there is limited permissions to use the image. If the photo can be reused, consider making the file name descriptive so it\u2019s easier to search for in the future. - Document : Provide a document name. This may be seen by the public, so use something that makes sense. - Video : Provide a video name.This is not seen by the public. 2. Reuse existing : If you or someone else has already uploaded the file you want to use, you can reuse it without having to re-enter the information. Search by the filename of the existing item or the name it was given when originally uploaded. When you find it, click the checkbox next to it. Then click the \u201cSelect\u201d button at the bottom of the window. Save the page for the selection to take effect. Content Browser For fields that allow you to reference an existing piece of content, you will see a button that says \u201cSelect Content.\u201d Clicking this button will open a new window called the content browser . Content browser. You can search for existing content by title, content type, group, topic, and/or author. When you find the content you want to use, click the checkbox next to it. Then click the \u201cFinish\u201d button at the bottom of the window. Save the page for the selection to take effect. Page Sections When adding or editing certain kinds of content, including program and county pages, projects, and web-based newsletters, you will need to manage content on the page via page sections . With this method, you add pieces of content to the page in chunks, one section at a time. There are several different types of sections you can use for different kinds of content on the page. Some sections are for basic page elements such as text and images. Others create dynamic lists that pull content onto the page. These include county or program events lists (which pull events) and program resource lists (which pull program resources). Once you set up one of these sections, it will automatically show new content as it is entered without you needing to update the page. The types of page sections available depend on the type of content you are working on. See Adding and Editing Content for details about the type of sections available for each type. You add page sections using the buttons at the bottom of the edit screen. Buttons to add page sections to a program page. You can reorder them by dragging them up and down the page using the arrow controls. For Advanced Users: Page Section Settings for Custom Design In the edit screen just above where you add and arrange page sections, there is a tab for \u201cSettings\u201d: When you switch to this tab, you will see the extra settings available for each section. The current available settings are: - Section ID : This allows you to link to a specific section on a page. The ID should be a short, unique name with no spaces or punctuation besides dashes (-) or underscores (_). When you give a section an ID, you can link directly to that section by adding \u201c#SECTION_ID\u201d to the end of the subpage\u2019s URL. - Background color : You can select a background color for the section that stretches all the way across the screen. The options are white or gray. \u201cCall to Action\u201d sections can also be black or orange. - List style : For sections that display content in a list (e.g. featured content and program resources lists), you can select the style to display each piece of content. You can choose between \u201cList,\u201d \u201cGrid,\u201d or \u201cText List\u201d (see below). \u201cList\u201d style. \u201cGrid\u201d style. \u201cText List\u201d style.
