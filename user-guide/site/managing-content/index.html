                <h1 id="managing-content">Managing Content</h1>
<p>Content needs management and maintenance after it has been added to the site in order to be effective.</p>
<h2 id="working-with-other-content-authors">Working with Other Content Authors</h2>
<p>Extension’s new digital strategy requires content authors to coordinate with one another more proactively than before. This includes communication outside of the county, department, or office where you do your everyday work.</p>
<h3 id="group-roles">Group Roles</h3>
<p>The people you will be working most closely with are other members of your groups. Group members should work together to plan, enter, evaluate, and maintain their content. Key responsibilities for group members include:</p>
<ul>
<li>evaluating and organizing existing content;</li>
<li>prioritizing content and identifying gaps;</li>
<li>revising and creating new content (as needed); and</li>
<li>entering content in the website (could designate a dedicated website editor).</li>
</ul>
<p>Certain members of a group may have a specific role.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Group leader</strong> (also called “EESC Contact”): the single point of contact and liaison between a content team and EESC</li>
<li><strong>Member manager</strong>: person or people responsible for adding members to the group</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="adding-people-to-a-group">Adding People to a Group</h3>
<p>Member &amp; Setting Managers in a group can add people to the group by going to the Group Content page for that group. At the top of the page, there is a “Members” tab.</p>
<p><img alt="Member Manager Group Tabs Screenshot" src="../images/member-manager-group-tabs.png" /></p>
<p>When you click on that tab, you will go to a page where you can edit (add or remove roles) or remove existing members. You can add a new member by clicking the “Add Member” button at the top of the page.</p>
<p><img alt="Add Member Screenshot" src="../images/add-member.png" /></p>
<p><em>Screen for adding members to a group</em></p>
<p>Enter the username of the person to add and check the box next to any roles the new member should have. Then click “Save.”</p>
<h3 id="contacting-a-group">Contacting a Group</h3>
<p>You may need to contact another group if you need to request membership or ask for content to be added or edited. There are lists of groups and their members on the <a href="http://blogs.oregonstate.edu/extensionweb/content-teams/">Content Teams page of the project blog</a>.</p>
<h3 id="finding-the-owner-of-a-piece-of-content">Finding the Owner of a Piece of Content</h3>
<p>If there are problems with a piece of content or you want to request a tag, you will need to find the person who entered the content. The content’s page lists its authors, but often the author is not the person who uploaded content to the site. This person is the content’s <strong>uploader</strong>.</p>
<p>You can find basic information about content, including its uploader and the group it belongs to, on the <a href="http://blogs.oregonstate.edu/extensionweb/content-teams/">Site Content Overview page</a>. (This page is also linked to from your “My Groups” page.)</p>
<p><img alt="Content Overview Screenshot" src="../images/content-overview.png" /></p>
<p><em>Content overview page</em></p>
<p>On this page, you can find a piece of content by searching for its title. You can also search by its type, uploader, group, topic, region, keyword, language, or publishing status.</p>
<p>Clicking on the username in the “Uploaded by” column of a piece of content will take you to the uploader’s profile. There, you can find their contact information. Sometimes the uploader will need to refer you to the Group leader to make decisions about changes.</p>
<h2 id="content-drafting-reviewing-publishing-archiving-and-deleting">Content Drafting, Reviewing, Publishing, Archiving, and Deleting</h2>
<p>In certain cases, you may want your content to be invisible to visitors. Most content entered into any website will eventually become out of date. Or you might want to review the content you entered before it gets published.</p>
<p>Content that is visible to public visitors is <strong>published</strong> and content that is not is <strong>unpublished</strong>. For most content types, there are three ways to be unpublished:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Draft</strong>: The content needs to be finished or reviewed before it gets published.</li>
<li><strong>In Review</strong>: The content was published, but has been taken down for review.</li>
<li><strong>Archived</strong>: The content was published, but is now out of date or no longer needed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that when you are viewing a piece of content that is unpublished, not visible to the public, it will have a pink background.</p>
<p>At the bottom of any edit screen, you will see one of two setups, depending on which type of content you are editing:</p>
<p><img alt="Published State Dropdown Screenshot" src="../images/published-state-dropdown.png" /></p>
<p>If you see this setup at the bottom of the page, you can use the dropdown to select “draft,” “in review.” or “archived.” This should be the setup you see most often.</p>
<p><img alt="Publishing State Checkbox Screenshot" src="../images/publishing-status-checkbox.png" /></p>
<p>In some cases (like when you’re adding social media links), you might see this setup instead. In this case, uncheck the “published” checkbox if you want to unpublish the content.</p>
<h3 id="new-drafts-of-published-content">New Drafts of Published Content</h3>
<p>If you update a piece of published content and set its state to “Draft,” the previous version of that content will remain visible. To hide all previous versions, set the state to “In Review” or “Archived” instead.</p>
<p>The edit screen for a piece of content will always contain the content from the latest draft. However, you can view both the latest draft and the currently published version.</p>
<p>To see the currently published version that is visible to the public, click on the content’s title on the Group Content page. You can also click the “View” tab at the top of the content’s edit screen.</p>
<p><img alt="Back End Tabs Screenshot" src="../images/draft-back-end-tabs.png" /></p>
<p>To see the latest draft of the content, click on the “Latest version” tab at the top of the content’s edit screen. These tabs are also visible below the title on the content’s page.</p>
<p><img alt="Draft Tabs Screenshot" src="../images/draft-tabs.png" /></p>
<p>At the top of the “Latest version,” you will see a control where you can publish the content and make the changes visible to the public:</p>
<p><img alt="Revision Log Control Screenshot" src="../images/revision-log-control.png" /></p>
<p>If you want to discard the draft and edit the currently published version of the content, you can “revert” to that revision of the content. See below for more details.</p>
<h3 id="viewing-previous-versions-of-content">Viewing Previous Versions of Content</h3>
<p>Making changes to a piece of content and saving it creates a new <strong>revision</strong>. If needed, you can look at all the previous revisions of a piece of content or revert content to a previous revision.</p>
<p>When you save a piece of content, you can enter a “Revision log message” to describe the changes you made or why you made them. You and other members of your group can see these messages later.</p>
<p><img alt="Revision Log Message Screenshot" src="../images/revision-log-message.png" /></p>
<p>To view the revisions for a piece of content, go to the edit screen for the piece of content. At the top of the page are several tabs, including a “Revisions” tab.</p>
<p><img alt="Edit Screen Tabs Screenshot" src="../images/edit-screen-tabs.png" /></p>
<p>When you click on this tab, you will see a list of all revisions for the content. The revision that is currently visible to visitors is highlighted in yellow and says “Current revision.” From this page, you can do several things:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>View a previous revision</strong>: Click on the date of the revision you want to view.</li>
<li><strong>Compare two revisions</strong>: Select the two revisions and click the “Compare Revisions” button at the bottom of the page. This will show you the differences between the two revisions by highlighting text that has been added, removed, or changed.</li>
<li><strong>Revert to a previous revision</strong>: Click the “Revert” button for the revision you want to revert to. This makes the selected revision the “current” revision. If needed, you can re-revert to the revision you were at originally with the same process.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="deleting-content">Deleting Content</h3>
<p>Deleting content will remove it and all of its previous versions from the site permanently. It is better to “archive” content rather than delete; you can still find it on the Group Content page when logged in if you want to update it and republish. It also helps avoid the content being inadvertently added again, since the reason it was “archived” can be noted in the revisions field for future reference.</p>
<p>Next to the Save button on an edit page you will also see the “delete” link. It is also an option in the drop down next to the content’s Edit button on the Group Content page.</p>
<p><img alt="Delete Content Screenshot" src="../images/delete-content.png" /></p>
<p>After clicking on “Delete” it will confirm if you are sure you want to delete it. Deleted content will no longer be accessible and cannot be restored. If you want to maintain a copy of the old content, you must copy and save this yourself beforehand.</p>
<h2 id="eesc-copyediting">EESC Copyediting</h2>
<p>The EESC pubs team will copyedit articles entered on the Extension website. When they make edits, a new draft of the content is created, so the original remains visible to the public and doesn't change. The person marked as the "EESC contact" for the group will get an email whenever a piece of content is copyedited. This will include a link where they can view the copyedited draft and approve the changes. You can also view a list of copyedited content in a group that needs to be approved by going to the group content page for that group and clicking the "Copyedits" tab at the top of the page.</p>
<p><img alt="Copyedit List Screenshot" src="../images/copyedit-dashboard.png" /></p>
<p>This page lists all content in the group that has been copyedited and needs approval. You can view the copyedited draft by clicking on the title of the content. It also lists the EESC pubs team member who copyedited the content. If you have questions about the changes that were made, click on their user name to go to their contact form.</p>
<p>When you view the draft for a copyedited piece of content, you can approve it using the moderation controls at the top of the content. Set the dropdown to "copyedited and published" and click the "Apply" button.</p>
<p><img alt="Moderation controls" src="../images/copyedit-moderation-controls.png" /></p>
<p>You can find more details about the changes made by going to the "Revisions" tab on the content page. This allows you to see notes left by the copyeditor and to compare the copyedited version to the previous version. See the previous section for more information about the revisions tab.</p>
<h2 id="displaying-and-organizing-content-on-other-pages">Displaying and Organizing Content on Other Pages</h2>
<p>In some cases, you might want content that exists on the site to show up on a specific page. The way to do this depends on where you want the content to show up, who added it, and what kind of content it is. Generally, this will involve:</p>
<ul>
<li>adding a tag to a piece of content;</li>
<li>asking the person who entered a piece of content to add a tag to it; and/or</li>
<li>adding a section to a page.</li>
</ul>

</table>
<p>*Please remember: Do not add educational content as a program resource. Program resources are for materials such as handbooks or forms that are only of interest to participants in a program.</p>
<p>Once content has been added to county or program pages, the sidebar where the pages are listed can be reordered, nested, or both (i.e., housed beneath a broader subpage). See <a href="../adding-editing/#subpage">Adding and Editing Content: Subpage</a> for more information.</p>
<h4 id="restricting-tagging-of-your-program">Restricting Tagging of Your Program</h4>
<p>If needed, you can set up your program so that only members of the program’s group can tag educational content with it. This means that only members of the program group would be able to make educational content appear on the program’s pages.</p>
<p>To do this, you need to have the role “Member &amp; Setting Manager” in the program’s group. Go to the Group Content page for the group and click the “Settings” tab at the top. This will take you to a page where you can manage the group’s settings. To restrict tagging to the program, check the “Restrict Tagging” box and then save.</p>

<h3 id="other-ways-to-group-content">Other Ways to Group Content</h3>
<p>Before putting in the effort to group content on a county or program page or Collection, check if the site can dynamically group the content for you.</p>
<p>Several pages on the site have filters in the sidebar that can group content automatically based on tags. You can link people to these pages with filters already applied. To do this, go to the page and apply the filters you want. Then, copy the URL in the address bar of your web browser and use it to create a link.</p>
