# Accessibility considerations for text editors on the Extension website

Text editors on the Extension website are fields with a row of icon buttons for formatting text. The bulk of text content on the Extension website is entered by content authors in one of these fields. Therefore, it is extremely important that content entered in them is [accessible](../content-requirements/#accessibility) to all visitors to the website, including those with disabilities.

## Emphasized text (all-caps, bold, italic)

  - **Avoid text in all-caps.** Screen readers (used by people who cannot see a screen well) may mistake it for an acronym and not read it correctly. Text in all-caps is also more difficult to read for people with conditions such as dyslexia, because all the letters are the same height.
  - **Avoid long passages of bold [B] or italicized [I] text.** Similarly, this text is difficult to read for people with conditions like dyslexia. To emphasize information, the best technique is to “eliminate its competition” i.e. make sure it is in a short paragraph, on a short page, etc.
  - **Do not use the ‘Format’ dropdown to enlarge/emphasize text.** This control is specifically intended for section headings. If it is used incorrectly, screen readers and other assistive technology will not be able to interpret the page section correctly.
  - **Do not use bold [B] text as section headings.** There is a dedicated control for section headings (see below). If it isn’t used, screen readers and other assistive technology will not be able to interpret the page structure correctly.

## Headings and section breaks

  - **Use the ‘Format’ dropdown to create section headings.** The top level headings in the text should use ‘Heading 2’, subheadings under those ‘Heading 3’, etc. Do not skip heading levels. Section headings in long text are extremely helpful for readability and accessibility.
  - **Do not use horizontal lines as the only section break indicator.** As a visual element, these are not accessible to people who aren’t looking at the screen. Use headings instead of/in addition to horizontal lines.

## Links

  - **Do not use the URL as the link label.** The “link label” refers to the text that a visitor clicks on to follow the link. The link label needs to be pronounceable in order for people using screen readers and other assistive technology in order to use them.
  - **Do not use generic link labels like “click here” or “website”.** People using screen readers or other assistive technology often get links out of the context of their surrounding text. The link label by itself should describe what the link goes to (e.g. the title of the page being linked to).
  - **Avoid multiple links on the same page with the same link label.** Similarly, people need to be able to figure out where a link goes when it is outside the context of its surrounding text. An example would be if you had a list of resources and a link for each with the label “Read more”. Better link labels would be “Read more about…”

## Lists (numbered and bulleted)

  - **All lists should have bullets or numbers.** Don’t use tables or plain line breaks to create a “list” without bullets/numbers.
  - **Use the bulleted/numbered list controls in the text editor to create lists.** You should never have to type the bullets/numbers manually.

## Tables

  - **Avoid tables whenever possible.** Tables are the most difficult type of web page content to make accessible. They are intended only for tabular data, not for creating a layout for text or a list.
  - **Avoid “complex” tables even more.** This refers to tables with cells that span multiple rows and/or columns.
  - **If you need to include a table, contact Extension Communications for help.**

## Other controls (footnotes, pull quotes, and blockquotes)

  - **Use the footnote control [a1] to create footnotes** that are linked to at the bottom of the page. The superscript control [x2] should only be used for mathematical equations, etc.
  - **Use the pull quote control to create a pull quote**, which is text that is enlarged and “pulled out” of the flow of the text like in a magazine. This control looks like one vertical line with several horizontal lines to the right. It’s between the blockquote [“] and horizontal line controls.
  - **Use the blockquote control to mark passages of quoted text.** If you are including a paragraph or paragraphs of text from another source, use the block quote control to style them as a quote on the page.
