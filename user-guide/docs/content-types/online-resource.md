## Instructions for Online Resources

To create an Online Resource, go to your My Groups page and select the appropriate *Content Team group*. Then, click the "Create Online Resource" button at the top of the page.

On the edit screen of an online resource, you will see the following fields:

  - **Website URL (required)**: the link to the resource
  - **Short Description (required)**: a description of the resource
  - **Thumbnail**: an image to go with the resource. If empty, it will use a default image based on the tagged topic.
  - **Tags (topic required)**: information about the resource to help with display, sorting, search, and promotion. See below for more details.
  - **Author and Publishing Information**: information about the content for future maintenance
    - If the content’s author is an OSU Extension employee, start typing their name into the first “Author(s)” field and select them when they come up. This will associate the content with their profile on the site.
    - If the content’s author is not an OSU Extension employee (including OSU employees who don’t have an Extension appointment), enter their information in the “Non-Extension Author(s)” fields.

## How and Where Online Resources Display

The tags in the “Topics, Keywords, Programs, and Regions” section of the edit screen determine where the online resource displays.

  - **Topic**: it will show in the “Browse All Resources” page for the specified topic(s)
  - **Program**: If the specified program has added a “Program Tagged Content List” section to one of its pages, it will show up there. See the [Subpage](#subpage) section for more information.
  - The other tags available to fill in are used for internal marketing purposes and/or populating the filters visitors use in search results or on topic pages.

Counties and Programs can feature Online Resources on their pages by selecting them in a page section (for example, a "featured content" section).
