# Newsletter Issue

## What Is a Newsletter Issue

Newsletter issues can be documents, links to an email newsletter service, or content entered into the website. They are organized into newsletter containers. For example the [*GROWING*](https://extension.oregonstate.edu/newsletter/growing) newsletter *container* includes the *issues* for Nov/Dec, Sept/Oct, July/Aug, etc.

## Who Can Add Newsletter Issues

Any user can add newsletter issues. However, you must enter an issue of a newsletter through the *same group* as the newsletter it belongs to.

**Step 1: Create the Newsletter Container**

The **first time** you upload a newsletter, you will need to create a container to hold all the issues together. To do this, go to the edit screen for a Newsletter Issue. Then click the “create a Newsletter container” link under the dropdown list of available newsletters.

Here, you can enter information about the newsletter that applies to *all issues* that it contains. The info you can enter is:

  - **About (required)**: information about the newsletter, for example, how often it is published or what it is about.
  - **Subscribe Link**: the link visitors can use to subscribe to the newsletter.
  - **Tags**: information about the newsletter to help with display, sorting, search, and promotion.
  - **Teaser settings**: thumbnail and short description that display in the newsletter's teaser. If the thumbnail is empty, it will use a default image based on the topic, program, or county.


**Step 2: Create Issues for the Newsletter**

To create a Newsletter Issue, go to your My Groups page and select the appropriate group (any type). Then, click the "Create Newsletter Issue" button at the top of the page.

On the edit screen for a newsletter issue, you will see the following fields:

  - **Issue Name (required)**: a title distinguishing it from other Issues (e.g. “GROWING: May - June 2019”)
  - **Associated Newsletter (required)**: the newsletter to which this issue belongs

  <blockquote><strong>Troubleshooting Tip</strong>: If the newsletter you want isn’t in the list, one of two things is happening:<br><br>
    <ol>
      <li>you aren’t adding the issue through the group the newsletter belongs to, or</li>
      <li>the newsletter hasn’t been created yet.</li>
    </ol>
  </blockquote>

  - **Issue Type (required)**: “Web Content,” “File Upload,” or “Link to Issue”
    - File Upload Issues: This type of issue consists of a document uploaded to the website. When you choose this option, you will see a file upload field.
    - Linked Issues: This type of issue consists of a page or document hosted on another website. This includes newsletters sent via MailChimp or in Box. When you choose this option, you will see a field to enter the URL of the issue.
    - Web Content Issues: This type of issue consists of content entered into the website. When you choose this option, you will be able to add content to the page using Page Sections. See [Page Sections](../using-site.md#page-sections) for information about adding and arranging content on the page. The types of page section available for newsletter issues are:
        - **Button Link**: a link to another page (in or outside of the Extension site) styled as a large orange button
        - **Call to action**: link to content or an external website with a custom title, description, and image.
        - **Featured Content**: links to content in the Extension site
        - **Image**: an image with optional caption and alternative text to describe the photo
        - **Image Slider**: a slideshow of uploaded images.
        - **Tabbed Section**: allows you to display other sections in tabs, where only one tab is displayed at a time and visitors can switch between them
        - **Text**: a simple text box with formatting such as bold or italic
        - **Text with Background**: a text section with a background image that stretches all the way across the page. This image should be at least 2000px wide.
        - **Two-Column Section**: allows you to display other sections in two columns instead of one (in large enough screens)
        - **Video**: an embedded video from YouTube, Vimeo, or OSU Media Space
  - **Teaser settings (short description required)**: thumbnail and short description that display in the issue's teaser. If the thumbnail is empty, it will use the thumbnail from the corresponding newsletter container. If this is unavailable, it will use a default image based on the topic.
  - **Author and publishing information**: Previous issues are arranged based on the “Date Published or Revised” entered here.
    - If the content’s author is an OSU Extension employee, start typing their name into the first “Author(s)” field and select them when they come up. This will associate the content with their profile on the site.
    - If the content’s author is not an OSU Extension employee (including OSU employees who don’t have an Extension appointment), enter their information in the “Non-Extension Author(s)” fields.

> **Quick Tip**: Web visitors often scan content on the web to see if it is useful for what they need. Make your newsletter content more readable by using these [Accessibility](../content-requirements.md#accessibility) and [writing for the web](../content-requirements.md#writing-for-the-web) tips.

## How and Where Newsletter Issues Display

Newsletter containers display automatically on topic and program pages based on their tags.

They can also be featured in page sections on topic landing pages, program pages, and county pages.

The newest issue of the newsletter will display with a thumbnail on the page for the newsletter container. The next five newest issues will display in a text-only list below it. Older issues can be accessed by clicking the "Newsletter archive" button below this list. The order of these lists depends on the "Date Published or Revised" set for each issue, in the "Step 3: Author and Publishing Information" section of the edit screen.

### Displaying Newsletter Sign-Up Forms

If you have a form people can use to sign up for your newsletter, there are several ways to display it on the site.

  - On the edit screen for the Newsletter container, there is a field for a “subscribe link.” You can enter a link to the form and it will display above the list of the issues for that newsletter.
  - If you want to add a link to the form on a program or county page, you can add a “button link” on the desired page or sidebar. See the relevant content type section in this guide for more information.
  - MailChimp and other email management systems often give you an embed code so you can display the sign-up form directly on a web page. [Here are instructions for how to get an embed code from MailChimp.](https://mailchimp.com/help/add-a-signup-form-to-your-website/) Once you have the embed code, add a “Text” section to the page. Click the “Source” button in the text editor to switch to HTML mode and paste the embed code there. You will see the form on the page when you click “Save.”
