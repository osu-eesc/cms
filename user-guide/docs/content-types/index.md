# Adding and Editing Content

How to add and edit content in the new Extension website depends on the content type.

## Content Entry Workflow

In general, you will need to follow these steps when entering content on the Extension website:

  1. See if the content already exists on the site.
    - See [Planning and evaluating content](../content-requirements.md#planning-and-evaluating-content).
  2. Determine whether the content is appropriate for the Extension website.
    - See [Getting Started with Content](../getting-started.md).
  3. Check that the content meets quality and legal standards.
    - See [Content Requirements and Best Practices](../content-requirements.md).
  4. Determine which Group and content type you should use.
    - See [Getting started with Content](../getting-started.md) and the Content Type descriptions below.
    - If you are planning to upload a file, check out [File Management](../content-requirements.md#file-management).
  5. Log in to the site and go to your My Groups page. Select the group you identified in step 4 and click the “add” button for the desired content type.
    - See [Using the site](../using-site.md).
  6. Fill out the fields for the content and save.
    - See the appropriate content type section below.
  7. Publish the content when it is ready.
    - See [Managing Content: Content Publishing](../managing-content.md#content-drafting-reviewing-publishing-archiving-and-deleting).
  8. Make sure that the content is displaying everywhere it needs to. Update the tags if necessary.
    - See [Displaying and organizing content on other pages](../managing-content.md#displaying-and-organizing-content-on-other-pages).
  9. Periodically check the content to ensure it is still relevant. Archive it if it goes out of date.
    - See [Managing Content: Content Publishing](../managing-content.md#content-drafting-reviewing-publishing-archiving-and-deleting) later in this guide.
