# County Office

## What Is a County Office

Represents information about a county, including address, contact information, and office hours, and content on its main page.

## Who Can Add County Offices

These have been set up for you. No one can add or delete them.

## Instructions for County Offices

The edit screen for a county office has three sections:

  - **Landing Page**: this is the main page visitors see for the county. Most of this page is automatically generated based on content you enter, but there are some things you can specify here:
    - **Hero image**: the full-width image that appears at the top of county pages.
    - **Introduction**: text at the top of the landing page to introduce the county.
    - **Quick links**: a bar of up to four highlighted links (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, a newsletter, or a calendar).
    - **About**: Additional text to describe the work done or sevices available in the county.
    - **Featured content section**: you can select a few content items to display on the landing page. We recommend listing newsletters or other content that is specific to the county.
  - **Other Content**: this is where you can specify other content related to the county. Specifically, the introductory text for automatically-generated pages (see below) and custom sidebar links.
  - **County Info**: the contact information, location, office hours, etc. for the county.

> **Quick Tip**: Members of county groups can feature educational content entered by Content Teams on their pages. See: [Organizing and Displaying Content on Other Pages](../managing-content.md#displaying-and-organizing-content-on-other-pages).

## How and Where County Offices Display

Each county has several automatically generated pages:

  - **Landing page**: the "main" page for the county that contains contact information and other info that people are usually looking for on county pages. This page has the following sections:
    - Introduction: text entered when you edit the county.
    - Quick links: content entered when you edit the county.

    - Social media: automatically generated list of social media links entered by the county.
  - **What We Do**: lists the focus areas for the county (see below) as well as the programs that are tagged with the county.

  - **Faculty and Staff**: lists the users on the site who work in the county.

There is a list of all counties on the [Find Us](https://extension.oregonstate.edu/find-us) page. The link to “Find Us” is in the top black menu bar at the top of every page. The sidebar on local participant-based program pages also have links to the counties where that program is active.
